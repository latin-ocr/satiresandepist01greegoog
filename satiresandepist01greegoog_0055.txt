HORATI SERMONES. 35

magna sonaturum, des nominis huius honorem.

Idcirco quidam comoedia necne poema 4⁵
esset quaesivere, quod acer spiritus ac vis

nec verbis nec rebus inest, nisi quod pede certo

differt sermoni, sermo merus.

‘At pater ardens

saevit, quod meretrice nepos insanus amica
filius uxorem grandi cum dote recuset, 50
ebrius et, magnum quod dedecuS, ambulet ante

noctem curn facibuS.’

audiret leviora, pater si viveret?

Numquid Pomponius istis

Ergo

non satis est puris versum perscribere verbiS,
quem si dissolvaS, quivis stomachetur eodem 55

quo personatus pacto pater.

His, ego quae nunc,

olim quae scripsit Lucilius, eripias si
tempora certa modosque, et quod prius ordine verbum est
posterius faciaS, praeponens ultima primiS,

losty style. As all poetry was origi-
nally to be sung, the Latin retains
figures in reference to its style de-
rived from sound which we have lost.

45. quidam: the Alexandriae
grammanans.

46. acer spiritus, a lively in·
spiration.

47. verbis, in the diction. —re·
bus, in tlte matter. ——pede certo,
by its flxed measure.

48 sermo,
comoedia. — at pater, etc.· the
objection of one who maintains that
comedy has passages of poetry in
it. A very common scene in com·
edy is that of the angry father under
the circumstances here referred to,
21:312er spendtleriffi used as

51. ambulet. a common form of
revelry was the comissati0‚ in which
the drinkers after a supper paraded
through the city with torches, com-
mitting all sorts of wild disorder.
Here it is done even before night,

in apposition with ⁷

the intoxicated youth doing it with·
out shame iu broad daylight.

52. numquid Pomponiae, etc.:
the reply is that any dissolute young
man would be addressed in the same
way in real life3 but to express this
Horace takes an actual case of a
young man of this kind, thus satir·
izing him as well as making out his
own point. These side thrusts are
very characteristic of the poet:

53. ergo: the reasoning ia, if
comedy has only the language of
real life, it cannot be called poetry
though put into metrical form.

55. dissolvas, i.e. change the
&der 56εὲ that the mette disappearS.

. v. .

56. hie, etc.: in the same way
Lucilius and Horace use only the
language of common conversation
put into metre3 whereas in the ex·
tract from Enn’ius in v. 60, there is
a poetic diction, and the thoughts
suggested are on a higher plane
than the language of common life.
