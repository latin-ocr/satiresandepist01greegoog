ΗΟΙΞΑΤΙ SERMONES. 67

corvorum, atque in me veniat mictum atque cacatum
Iulius et fragilis Pediatia furque VoranuS.

Singula quid memorem ? quo pacto alterna loquentes 40
umbrae cum Sagana resonarent triste et acutum,

utque lupi barbam variae curn dente colubrae
abdiderint furtim terriS‚ et imagine cerea

largior arserit igniS, et ut non testis inultus

horruerim voces Furiarum et facta duarum : 45
nam, displosa sonat quantum vesica, pepedi

gives a comio effect to the story,
just as if one said, “You may not
believe it, but it’s a fact,’' at the
end of a Munchausen tale. Of
course his oath is suited to his
nature.

39. Iulius, etc.: another side
thrust. The first person is unknown,
buthe must be the same sort of per-
son as the others who are described.
—- fragilis, the weakling: of effemi-
nacy. — Pediatia: really a man,
but spoken of thus on account of
his effeminacy.

40. alterna, i.e. of questions and
answers,

41. resonarent: the imperfect
cannot be explained. Either the
reading resonarint ought to be
adopted, or we must suppose it a
lapse on Horace's part. — triste et
acutum: the feeble and piping
{gele reggarJJ ατξῖτὲὺιιῐεᾶ to the

es. . en. . .

42. lupi barbam: tffge seem to
have been charms against opposing
magio on the part of others.

43. cerea: dissyllabic by syni-
zesis.

44. arserit: i.e. the wax melted
and ran into the fire. This has not
been mentioned before, but is un-
derstood as one of the regular ac·
companiments. Cf. note to v. 30.
—ut non, etc., how it was not as
an unavenged spectator that, etc.

45. Furiarum: cf. note to v. 27.

46. quantum: a kind of cogn.
acc. with sonat.

48. dentes, salse leeth, which
were not uncommon among the
ancients. — caliendrum, some sort
of a headdreSS‚ the form of which is
unknown. It was evidently, how·
ever, tall, and perhaps some Eastern
cap, like the Persian tiara, for in-
stance.

49. herbas, vincula: the ma·
chinery of their magic that they
held in their armS. — incantata,
equal to enchanted, i.e. arranged
with spells, solemn formulae to give
magic power. The vincula would
be love-knots to bind fast the per·
son to be affected. The whole is
probably not very exact.

50. videres, you 11:22ng have seen

(Gr. ς 311, a).
