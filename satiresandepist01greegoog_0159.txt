Per totum hoc tempus subiectior in diem et horam

erly in apposition with nugaS. —-
Thraex, tlze Thracian, i.e. a gladi-
ator in Thracian arms, a round
shield and curved sword. The Ro·
mans were fond of fights 'in which
gladiators of different and outland·
ish arms were matched against each
other, and they talked about their
favorites much as our sporting men
talk about oarshen and bau-players.
— Gallina, the Chicken, a nickname.
— Syro: a gladiator’s name, prob-
ably of a mirmillo (the kind that
usually fought against the ThraeceS,
cf. Cic. Phil. 111. 12, Suet. Dom. ιο)

a large, strong shield, and heavy
armor.

The whole means that Horace was

news, — a Rostris: 2‘.e. from the μ,
rostra, where news would be an· Q (Μ),

nounced to the crowd in the Forum ;
or if not publicly announced first
made known there. —per compita,
by the street correers, where the
next largest assemblies of men would
be collected.

5¹· quicumque, etc.: further ex-
plaining the invidia, but at the

from that supposed by the envious
crowd. —- O bone, my good friend,
but apparently with a touch of
depreciation. ,
