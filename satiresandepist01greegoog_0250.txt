HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. Ι.

curaS, interdum nugaris rure paterno, ’ ’ 60 ·
Partitur lintres exercitus; Actia pugna
te duce per pueros hostili more refertur:
adversarius est frater, lacus Hadria, donec
alterutrum velox victoria fronde coronet.
Consentire suis studiis qui crediderit te, 65
fautor utroque tuum laudabit pollice ludum.

Protinus ut moneam, si quid monitoris eges tu,
quid de quoque viro et cui dicas saepe videt0.
Percontatorem fugit03 narn garrulus idem est,
nec retinent patulae commissa fideliter aures, 70
et semel emissum volat irrevocabile verbum.

Non ancilla tuum iecur ulceret ulla puerve
intra marmoreum venerandi limen amici,
ne dominus pueri pulchri caraeve puellae

i.e. you would do nothing frivolous
or trifling; you are not above rep-
resenting a mimic battle„ a fact
which shows that you have no ex·
cuse for absenting yourself from
active sports. - extra numerum
modumque: i.e. unboeoming, out
of character, or contrary to pro·
priety; a regular expression drawn
from the art of musi03 lit. out of
time and tune.

60. rure paterno: i.e. in the
retirement of the country, so often
referred to; cf. Sat. 11. 1. 73.

62. pueros ε either slaves or boys,
either os which classes might en-
gage in the sport.

64. velox, winged.

65. consentire, etc.: a return to
the main idea after the long paren-
thesiS. '

66. utroque: as we might say,
vote with both hands. — pollice:
the allusion must be to the amphi-
theatre, at which perhaps gentle-
manly applause was given by the
thumb turned down (pressus) and

striking the railing or some other
object. The opposite to this is
pollicem vertere, holding up the .
thumb. The origin of the custom
is uncertain: perhaps it was like
“pointing the finger of scorn,'' and
from that the opposite came to sig-
nify approval.— ludum: the regu-
lar word for gladiatorial exercise3
here figuratively of the action of
the client, who is approved sor
joining in his patron's favorite pur-
suits.

67. protinus ut moneam, etc.:
a warning against indisereet com-
ment on others' characters, and too
much indulgence shown to the in-
quisitive “interviewer.'’ Cf. Sat.
II. 5. 51, although there the subject

' is a different one.

70. patulae: with a> double ref-
erence. The ears are wide open to
catch, but they sor the same reason
readily let go what they have heard.

72. non: cf. Sat. 11. 5. 91.—
ancilla, etc.: cf. Od. 11. 43 Virg.
Ecl. 11.- iecur: the seat of the
