HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. 11.

ventum est Esquilias, aliena negotia centum

per caput et circa saliunt latus.

‘ Ante secundam

Roscius orabat sibi adesses ad Puteal cras! 35
‘ De re communi scribae magna atque nova te

orabant hodie meminisseS‚ Quinte, reverti.’

‘ Imprimat his cura Maecenas signa tabellis)

DixeriS‚ ‘ Experiar :’

‘ Si vis, poteS,’ addit et instat.

Septimus octavo proprior iam fugerit annuS, 40
ex quo Maecenas me coepit habere suorum
in numero ; dumtaxat ad hoc, quem tollere raeda
vellet iter facienS,' et cui concredere nugas
hoc genus: ‘Hora quota est?'--‘Thraex est Gallina

Syro par? ’ -

33. Esquilias: on the Esquiline
was Maecenas’s house and a fine
gamem—negotia, a airs.

34. saliunt, assai ,· the figure is
too strong to be literally rendered,
though it was originally in our Eng-
lish word as well. ——ante, etc.: the
words of a messenger of Roscius
who had some claim or other upon
the poet.—ante secundam: i.e.
in the first twelfth of the day.

35. orabat: like the epistolar-y
imperfect, which is written with ref·
erence to the time of the reading.
Very likely the messages are con-
ceived as written and quoted ver-
batim. -— Puteal: the Puteal Libo·
nis, a kind of well curb in the Forum
(cf. Ep. Ι. 19. 8) around a place
once struck by lightning. As it was
near the tribunal of the praetor, the
matter was probably a judicial one
in which Horace would appear as
advocatus. Cf. 1. 9. 38.

36. de re communi, etc„ a new
matter of great importance to our
body. Horace had once been a regu·
lar clerk of the treasury. The expres-
sions aliena negotia, reverti, and
re communi seem to indicate that

he was a clerk still, but only a nomi·
nal one. Cf. the caseos Sarmentu8‚

37. meminissem, you will not
fhrget. — Quinte, friend Horace ’
(cf. 11. 5. 32), as the praenomen in·
dicates intimacy. -- reverti, come
in, probably to the office of the
quaestors, which he would not al-
vsiays do if he was a mere nominal
c erk.

38. imprimat, etc.: the words
of some one who wished to get
a favor from Maecenas through
Horace’s influence.

39. dixeris, if you (i.e. Horace)
say ,· hortatory subjunctive. — si
vis, etc.: this statement Horace
ingeniously uses as a transition to
his relations with Maecenas.

40. septimuS, etc.: this would
give as the date of the Satire B.c. 31,
as that of his introduction was about
ρο. 38. Cf. Dacis, v. 53.

42. dumtaxat ad hoc, merely to
this extent,· i.e. not in a close in·
timacy as a confidential friend.

43. nugas: i.e. only the merest
trifles of conversation.

44. hoc genus, ofthis sort, prop· 0
