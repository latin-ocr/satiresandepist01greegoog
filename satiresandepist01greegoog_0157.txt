‘ Heia,

ne prior officio quisquam respondeat, urge !’

Sive Aquilo radit terras seu bruma nivalem 25
interiore diem gyro trahit, ire necesse est. ’
Postmodo quod mi obsit clare certumque locuto,
luctandum in turba et facienda iniuria tardis,

‘ Quid viS, insane, et quas res agis? ⁹ improbus urget
iratis precibus ; ‘ tu pulses omne quod obstat, 30
ad Maecenatem memori si mente recurras ?'

Hoc iuvat et melli est, non mentiar.

23. Romae: as opposed to the
undisturbed quiet of country life.
— sponsorem, as a bondsman.
In the Roman legal proceedings
there were many cases in which bail
was n , so that it seems to
have been a common friendly ff·

ctum to act as security. Cf.1.1. 11
and Ep. ΙΙ. 2. 67. The trials began
about nine (cf. I. 9. 35); and prob-
ably the preliminary proceedings
(in iure) were earlier. —Heia,
etc.: the poet's own reflection is put
into the mouth of the god.

24. prior, before you. — officio.
cf. note to v. 23, and officiosus, ΙΙ.

24. respondeat: answer to the
call of duty, i .e. perfhrm the duty
itself.

25. Aquilo, etc.: notwithstand-
ing the raw wind or freezing cold,
the Tramontana. —radit‚ rasps.

26. interiore: i.e. at the winter
solstice, when the short day seems
to make a circle of small diameter,
as the sun does in the heaven.—
trahit: as if the day came unwil-
lingly to an end.

27. postmodo: with obsit.—
obsit‚ cause loss, when by and by
he has to pay the amount of his
surety. ·— clare ι i .e. without shrink·
ing-certum: in the exact form

At simul atras

prescribed, as otherwise the act
would be invalid.

28. luctandum, etc.· i. e. he has
at once to hurty away to the next
duty, his morning call (salutatio)
on Maecenas—facienda, etc.: in-
dicating his hurry in a more lively
way by its effects.

29. quid vis, etc.:
strance of the persons he runs
against. — improbu8‚ impudently.

30. precib us, imprecations.-pul-
ses, do you think you must knock

question.

31. ad Maecenatem, ete: im·
plying that his relation to Maecenas
is kmwn and envied. —memori

him. Theoe seems to be an implied
taunt.

32. melli est, is sweet as honey
to me.—non mentiar, I will not
deny, i.e. to tell the truth, though
the statement is contrary to my
argument. The words contain also
of course a compliment to Maecenas.
—atz i.e. but when Ι arrive it is no
better, as it might be, if it were only
on the way that he was subject to
these annoyanceS‚ which after all
have their compensations as he has
just said—atras: cf. 1. 8. 10.
