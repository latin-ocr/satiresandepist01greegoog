58 HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. Ι.

obiciet nemo sordes mihi quas tibi, Tilli,

cum Tiburte via praetorem quinque sequuntur

te pueri, lasanum portantes oenophorumque.

Hoc ego commodius quam tu, praeclare senator, 110

milibus atque aliis vivo.

Quacumque libido est,

incedo solus ; percontor quanti holus ac far3
fallacem circum vespertinumque pererro

saepe forum ; adsisto divinis; inde domum me

wi·

ad porri et ciceris refero laganique catinum. ss 2* 115
Cena ministratur pueris tribus, et lapis albus '
pocula cum cyatho duo sustinet ; adstat echinus

nor baggage except a pair of saddle-
bags behind him on the same mule.

107. obiciet, etc.: i.e. such a
proceeding would not in Horace
indicate stinginess (sordes), as it
would in the case of Tillius (prob-
ably the same mentioned in v. 24).

108. Tiburte via, a frequented
road, and only a short distance,
where one would expect him to
appear properly.— praetorem: as
a magistrate a man ought to keep
up a still more brilliant state.—
quinquez a small number even for
an ordinary gentleman. Cf. 3. 11.

109. lasanum: his kettle for
cooking his meals along the road,
instead of stopping at a tavern, or
receiving hospitality which he would
not like to return—oenophorum,
wine-basket‚ carried in the same
manner as the kettle.

1 10. ‘hoe (neuter), in this respect.
— tu: without special reference, but
making the whole vivid by singling
out some one person, as it were.

· 111. milibus: neuter.

112. solus: see notes on vs, 101
seq. An example of the thousand
other things.—percontor: i.e. he
strolls about the market‚ and acts as
a humble citizen pricing his own
provisione..

113. fallacem circum: the re·
gion of the Circus Maximus (the
valley where was the early commer-
cial forum) seems to have been the
resort of all kinds of loose charac-
ters. Shops occupied the outer walls
of the substructions of the building.
Horace doubtless refers to sharperS,
confidence men, and the like, who
always ply their trade in the lower
parts of a city.

113. vespertinum z tle, when
the refuse of the people were out,
as in any great city.

1 14. divinis: fortune-tellas, as-
trologerS‚ and the like.— inde ε from
his stroll.

115. porri, etc.: as a simple re-
past without daintieS, but of course
not to be taken too literally. —- la-
εἛἙῬίἒῡῗὲἵ οὲῗῖἳξὲἓ· a sunau
number for the Romans, — pueris:
the poetic (and colloquial ?) use of
the dative to express the agent. —
lapis albus: only white marble,
not the variegated and costly foreign
sorts.

117. poeula duo: for wine and
water, which the Romans generally
mixed. -— cyatho, the little ladle
for measuring the quantities in mix·
ing. -- echinus, an unknown uten-
