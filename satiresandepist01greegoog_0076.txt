56 HORATI SERMONES·

[Lm. Ι.

Ipse mihi custos incorruptissimus omnis

circum doctores aderat.

Quid multa ? Pudicum,

qui primus virtutis honOS, servavit ab omni

non solum fact0, verum opprobrio quoque turpi;

nec timuit sibi ne vitio quis verteret, olim 85
si praeco parvas aut, ut fuit ipse, coactor

mercedes sequerer; neque ego essem questus: at, hoc

nunc

laus illi debetur et a me gratia maior.
Nil me paeniteat sanum patris huiuS, eoque

non, ut magna dolo factum negat esse suo parS,

90

quod non ingenuos habeat clarosque parenteS,

crowd of a gstat city, as opposed to
a little provincial town. Cf.

Postremo in magno populo mulierem in-
Arrizziifetagportet omnis qui quod deut habent.

Plant. T ruc. 1. ι. 55.—

ut 2 as is natural, or expected. —
vidisset . . . crederet: ς 308. a.

81. custos: it was customary to
send boys in charge of a trustworthy
slave (paedagogus), as nowadays
girls in charge of a nurse. This
office the father performed him·
self.

82. quid multa: sc. dicam, tle.
why should 1 say more on a point
that every one understands?

83. honos, ornament: purity of
morals would be the first and high·
est virtue.

tioneer, a very common humble
occupation. — coactor, a collector,
of taxes and the like.

87. mercedes, the wages of a
humble profession—essem ques-
tus: i.e. if it had turned out so,
1 should not have found fault with
him for unfitting me for that hum-
ble life. In this sentence the close
connection between the ‘ future con·
dition’ and the ⁶ contrary to fact
construction ’ is very apparent, se-
querer being a future condition in
an indirect form changed to past
time, but it also answers for the
condition contrary to fact of essem
questus.— hoc, on this account,
i.e. because he did so educate me.
— nunc, now, as it is.

89. paeniteat, etc„ could I re-

84. facto . . . opprobrio: sc. he gret having· had such a father? i.e.

not only committed no impropriety,
but gave no handle for slander.

85. nec timuit: tle, he did. not
refrain from giving me this educa-
tion for fear any one should com-
plain that he was educating his son
above his station, even if the son
rose no higher than he himself.—
vitio verteret, charge it as a fault,-
ἓ 233·

86. praeco, a crier, an auc-

under any supposable circumstances,
an apodosis with an indefinite prot-
asis omitted. The whole idea is,
that while others might be ashamed
of their fathers if they were of low
birth, he had no such feeling.

90. negat, etc.: tle. most per-
sons would apologize for such a
father, saying that it was not their
fault that that they had such, while
admitting that it was a dishonor.
