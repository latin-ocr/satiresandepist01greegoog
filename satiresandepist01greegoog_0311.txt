HORATI EPISTVLAE.

latior amplecti murus vinoque diurno

placari Genius festis impune diebus, 210
accessit numerisque modisque licentia maior.

Indoctus quid enim saperet liberque laborum

rusticuS, urbano confusuS, turpis honesto ?

Sic priscae motumque et luxuriam addidit arti

tibicen traxitque vagus per pulpita vestem ; 215
sic etiam fidibus voces crevere severiS,

et tulit eloquium insolitum facundia praecepS,
utiliumque sagax rerum et divina futuri

sortilegis non discrepuit sententia Delphis,

Carmine qui tragico vilem certavit ob hircum, 220

grew, and instead of being merely
a support for the chorus, the music
became a pleasure in itself.

209. diurno: cf. solido de die,
Od. 1. 1. 20. The whole gives a
picture of license and festivity as
opposed to the (supposed) earlier
religious simplicity of the Greek
Tragedy.

210. Genius: ef. II. 1. 144. —
impune: τῖε. without restraint.

211. numeris modisque: cf.
ΙΙ. 2. 144.

212. saperet: τῖε. have just ideas
and good taste to hold in check
the extravagant growth of sensuous
music. —liber laborum: the recoil
from hard work would increase the
wildness of dissipation.

213. confusus: the mingling of
country and city would increase the
evil teudencies3 so also would the
conquion of classes (turpis hon-
esto .

214· sic: τῖε. from these causes.
—motum, etc.: τῖε. to the stately
measures of the old music greater
liveliness and more florid ornament
were added.

215. traxit: alluding to the long
tunic which the piper wore on the
stage—vagum τῖε. he had full

possession of the stage, instead of
being merely a supportet of the
vorces.

216. fidibus: τῖε. the lyre also
went through the same develop-
ment.— voces crevere: alluding
to the gradual in‘crease of the num·
ber of strings of the lyre, but ex-
pressing also the more free develop-
ment of the music. — severis, earn·
est, or serious in the simplicity of
its strains.

217. et tulit, etc.: τῖε. the same
change took place in the style of
the choral song. This forms in a
manner the connection of v. 202 seq.
wit-h v. 93 seq.—tulit, brought in.
——sacundia praeceps, fervid elo-
quence, as a quality os the writer,
while eloquium refers to the result
produced.

218. utilium rerum: τῖε. moral
precepts and wise sawS‚ such as
abound in Euripides.

219. non discrepuit, etc.: τῖε.
it did not differ much from the style
of the inspired oracles, doubtless in
obscurity as well as wildness.

220. qui, etc.: i.e. the earliest
tragedian. Cf. 11. 1. 163. —hir-
cum: cf. the commonly received
derivation of τραγῳδός, from τρά·
