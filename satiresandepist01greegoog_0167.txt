vn. 25-57.] HORATl SERMONES. 147
obvolvas vitium ? ’ Quid, si me stultior ipso

quingentis empto drachmis deprenderis? Aufer

τηε voltu terrere3 manum stomachumque tenet0,

dum quae Crispini docuit me ianitor edo· 45

Te coniunx aliena capi-t, meretricula Davum.
Peccat uter nostrum cruce dignius? Acris ubi me
natura intendit, sub clara nuda lucerna
quaecumque excepit turgentis verbera caudae,
clunibus aut agitavit equum lasciva supinum, 50
dimittet neque famosum neque sollicitum ne
ditior aut formae melioris meiat eodem.
Tu cum proiectis insignibus, anulo equestri
Romanoque habitu, prodis ex iudice Darna
turpis, odoratum caput obscurante lacerna, 53
non es quod simulas? Metuens induceriS, atque
altercante libidinibus tremis ossa pavore.

42. quid si, etc.: the slave takes
up the reproach of Mulvius, — me,
etc.: the qualities here mentioned
were especially ascribed to slaves.
(ἐξ. vv. 102, 1093 ΙΙ. 6. 1093 I. 3.
hussiissffiffilffssissifflssssaffi
a low price for a slave of any worth.
—deprenderisz not merely found
to be, but fhund out to be, or detected
in being, as if caught in his pretence
of virtue. — aufer, don't try. Hor-
ace represents himself as angered
by the reproach, thus indicating that
the blow has struck home. Where-
upon the slave replies, as it were,
“ Oh, you needn't try to frighten me
with your frowns3 wait till I show
you why.''

44. terrere ε with aufer, as a
complementary infinitive, in accord·
ffiffinfflivffiiffinyfffilesshssss

meaning is akin to the verbs which·
take that construction regularly.
The charges are of course over-
drawn, and Horace does not have
reference to himself alone, but he
includes himself along with others..
Cf. v. 111. and Ep. Ι. 1. 97, etc.

5 3. tu: referring to any respectable
person, not necessarily Horace, of
whom we do not know that he was
an eques. Still his military tribune·-
ship makes it possible.

54. Romane, ete.= i.e. the toga..
—ex iudice, etc.: i.e. you change
your station from an eques to a
slave, and in fact are what you pre·
tend to be, which is in accordanee
with the Stoic dogma, omnem stul·
tum esse servum.

55. lacerna ε a coarse‚ rough
cloak, often with a capuchin or
hood‚ as is intimated here.

57. libidinibus ε dative after
verbs of contending‚ as in Greek.
