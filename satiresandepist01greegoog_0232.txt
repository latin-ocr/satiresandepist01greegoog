HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 1.

maior utrum populum frumenti copia pascat,

collectosne bibant imbres puteosne perennes ‘ 15

iugis aquae; (narn vina nihil moror illius orae.

Rure meo possum quidvis perferre patique;

ad mare cum veni, generosum et lene require,

quod curas abigat, quod cum spe divite manet

in venas animumque meum, quod verba ministret, 20

quod me Lucanae iuvenem commendet amicae).

Tractus uter plures leporeS, uter educet apros ;

utra magis pisces et echinos aequora celent

pinguis ut inde domum possim Phaeaxque reverti,

scribere te nobiS, tibi nos adcredere par est. 25
MaeniuS, ut rebus maternis atque paternis ⁶

fortiter absumptis urbanus coepit haberi,

scurra vaguS, non qui certum praesepe teneret,

14. maior, etc.: continuing the
question in vv. 1 and 2. Inquiries as
to the bread and water of the re-
gion.

15. collectos: i.e. in cisterns‚
rain water being less agreeable than
that of wells.

16. narn vina. etc.': i.e. Ι ask
about the water, for 1 don’t care for
the wine there. ·

17. rure mee, eta: the‘poet ex·
plains his fastidiousness in regard
to the wine ; i.e. at home in retire-
ment he doesn't mind what he has.
—perferre, get along with,· cf. Ι.

16. 4.

lg. ad mare, etc.= i.e. in the
social life of a witering-place to
which he goes for relaxation. -
generosum et lene, fine and mel·
low, as more stimulating.

19. curae, ερατ cf. Ι. 5. 17, and
Od. 1. 18. 4, a very common idea
with the poet.

21. Lucanae: tle. at Velia.

22. tractus, etc.: continuing the
questions in reference to the sood.

24. Phaeax: cf. 1. 2. 28 and Ῑ. 4. 15. ·

25. par est: cf. the common
aessgiuffiaeeztiuass' ιὲἒῗίῐξιέδῇἔὲῒο, in
order to explain the Epicurean tone
of his questions, goes on to illus·
trate his double character by the
story of a ruined bon vivant, who
retained his appetite, but could ad-
just himself to circumstances. This
account, though humorously exag-
gerated, is in perfect accord with
Horace's statement of his lapses into
Agrist‘rppean philosophy. Cf. 1. 1.
1 , 19. .

27. fortiter: a humorous misap-
plication of a noble quality to an
unworthy action. The fearlessness
would consist in his‘ disregard of
consequaces—urbanus, a hunger
on, who lives by his wits. —haberi,
to act as, lit. to be considered such
by the patrons who invited him.

28. vagus: i.e. not dining at his
own house, but wherever he could
get an invitation, as explained in
the following.
