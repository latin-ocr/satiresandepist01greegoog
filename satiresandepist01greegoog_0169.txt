tot tantisque minor, quem ter vindicta quaterque
imposita haud umquam misera formidine privet?
Adde super, dictis quod non levius valeat: nam,
sive vicarius est qui servo paret, uti mos

vester ait, seu conservus, tibi quid sum ego? Nempe 80 .
tu, mihi qui imperitaS, alii servis miser, atque
duceriS, ut nervis alienis mobile lignum.

Quisnam igitur liber? Sapiens, sibi qui imperiosuS,
quem neque pauperieS, neque morS, neque vincula ter-

rent,

responsare cupidinibuS, contemnere honores · 85

externi ne quid valeat per leve morari, ¹

in quem manca ruit semper fortuna.
ex his ut proprium quid noscere?

57.-vindicta: in the process of
manumission per vindictam, a *for-
mal claimant asserted a right to the

course in the technical sense- the
sage, the ideal perfect man of the
Stoics. - sibi imperiosus: i.e. over
whom no one but himself has an
imperium.

84. pauperies, εἴας these evils
being mere accidents independent
of virtue, the solum bonum, of
course have no effect on the truly
wise man.

85. responsare, deff, depending
on fortis.

86. totus, etc.: i.e. independent
