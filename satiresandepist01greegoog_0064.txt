44 HORATI SERMONES.

linquimus, insani ridentes praemia scribae, 35
praetextam et latum clavum prunaeque vatillum.

In Mamurrarum lassi deinde urbe manemuS,

Murena praebente domum, Capitone culinam.

Postera lux oritur multo gratissima ; namque

Plotius et Varius Sinuessae Vergiliusque 40
occurrunt, animae, qualis neque candidiores

terra tulit, neque quis me sit devinctior alter.

O qui complexus et gaudia quanta fuerunt!

Nil ego contulerim iucundo sanus amico,

Proxima Campano ponti quae villula tectum 45
praebuit, et parochi quae debent ligna salemque.

for burning incense before him.
Whether this display was in honor
of the distinguished visitorS, as is

’,Η-ι’ *fut-very likely, does not appear.—11-

beuter, i.e. we are glad not to stop Ἴ

there.

3 . insani, weak·headed .·
his ead was turned by his position.
—- scribae: tle. a mere clerk who
had risen to the office. Tbese clerks

i.e.

Α might be of low origin, =or even

freedmen. Cf. v. 66.

37. Mamurrarum urbe: For-
miae, a town twelve miles further.
The form of expression no doubt
contains a bit of satire. Mamurra
was a knight from Formiae, whose
other names even are not known,
who rose through the favor of Julius
Caesar to wealth and some distinc-

tion, but spent his wealth in extrav· ἡ

agant living, and never possessed a
very noble reputation. Of his fam-
ily (implied in the plural) nothing
whatever is known—manemus
spend the night. Cf. v. 87.

38. Murena: L. Licinius Teren·
tius Varro Murena, the brother of
Terentia, Maecenas’ wife, apparently
had like many noble Romans a
villa at Formiae3 as probably also

Fonteius did, who entertained the
travellers at dinner (culinam).

40. Plotius: Plotius Tucca, whom
with Varius, both literary friends of
Virgil, that poet made his literary
executorS. Cf. I. 10. 44 and 81, and
I. 6. 5 5.- Sinuessae, eighteen miles
from F ormiae, towards Campania.

41. qualis z we should expect
quibus depending on candidiores,
but the poet says, “of a kind of
which kind the earth has produced
none fairer than they.''

42. neque quis, and to whom
no, etc.

44. sanus, in my senses.

ἤές Campano ponti, a bridge

ree miles from Sinuessa) over
the Savo, a small river just north of
the Volturnus. ΤΙιε word Campano
seems to be used loosely, as the
real boundary between Latium and
Campania is a few miles farther
north. —villula: apparently an inn
especially for public officerS, who
regularly travelled at the public ex-

ense.

p 46. parochi, the stewards ,· ap·
parently persons whose duty it was
to furnish the entertainment which
the cities were bound to supply to
