HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. ΙΙ.

Sed tamen est operae pretium cognoscere, quales

aedituos habeat belli spectata domique

230

virtus indigno non committenda poetae.

Gratus Alexandro regi magno fuit ille

ChoeriluS, incultis qui versibus et male natis ·

rettulit acceptos regale nomisma Philippos.

Sed veluti tractata notam labemque remittunt 235
atramenta, fere scriptores carmine foedo

splendida sacta linunt.

Idem rex ille, poema ’

qui tam ridiculum tam care prodigus emit,
edicto vetuit ne quis se praeter Apellen

pingeret aut alius Lysippo duceret aera

is that poems are to be paid for in
advance

229. sed tamen,etc.: i.e. though
we often injure our prospects by the
faults enumerated, still it is well
worth while for the patron to take
an active part in looking out for
a worthy herald of his praises. —
cognoscere, to consider well, ex·
amine into the case and determine;
an almost judicial word in this
sense.

230. aedituos (μυσταγωγοί),ίεηι·
ple guides, ciceroni, the guardians
os a temple who, like the sacristan
in modern times, showed visitors
about, and dilated upon the beau-
ties of statues and pictures. Cf. Cic.
in Verr. II. iv. 59. 132. The figure
has too much local color to be at
once appreciated in English. The
virtue is set up in a temple as an
object of veneration, and the poet
is the cicerone who points out its
beauty or sanctity, or what not.
Only a great poet is worthy to per-
form such service.

232. gratus, etc.: tle. to be sure,
Alexander allowed Choerilus with
his wretched verses to win solid

coin, but this is only an exception,

240

and usually a poorwriter dims the
praises of the hero he sings.

233. Choerilus: awretched poet
who was in favor with Alexander,
and wrote his exploits. —- incultiS,

uncouth. —- male natis, ill-fivted, -

i.e. doomed to failure from their
birth, the opposite os felix. —- ver-
sibus, or, etc„ but in the Latin,
dative (lto their credit).

234. rettulit acceptos, pocketed,
a mercantile term, meaning to put
to the credit side of an account.
The poems are the nomen to which
the credit is made. — regale no·
misma, good royal coin, implying
that it was a regal reward. χ

235. tractata notam, etc.: cf.
the English proverb of touching
pitch. — remittunt, leave, properly
gwe 0 .

23 . foedo: almost like the Brit· ’
ish “ nasty,'’ but with the figure sus-
tained as in splendida, linunt (be-
smirck, and so dim the brightness).

237. idem rex ille, etc: i.e. that
was the only case in which he was
so unwase.

240. alius Lysippo: cf. Ι. 16.
20 and note.— duceret: cf. Plin.

H. Ν. VII. 37 (125).
