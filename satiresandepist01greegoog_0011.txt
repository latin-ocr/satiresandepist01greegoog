PREFACE.

——000—

Tms book is intended for use in the class-room. There are
therefore many things in the notes which the advanced Latin
scholar may pass over. But the editor has derived so much
advantage from editions of the Classics in which the notes
reminded him in particular connections of things which in
general he knew before, that he has not inquired so much ο
whether a thing was likely to be known, as whether it was
likely to be thought of in the connection. The notes are
intended not so much to aid the student in the study of the
Latin language as in the study of Horace, —what he meant,
’ how he felt, and what prompted him to write as he did. In
accordance with the plan of the “ College SerieS,'' the notes

are put at the bottom of the page to facilitate reference. The *

editor is persuaded that college students sufficiently advanced
to undertake Horace, ought no longer to get and recite Iessons‚
but to study the literature, and understand and enjoy it. If
the editor’s suggestions enable anybody to do this, his purpose

will have been accomplished.
