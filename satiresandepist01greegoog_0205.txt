HORATI EPISTVLAE. 183

quid maris extremos Arabas ditantis et Indos,

ludicra quid plausus et amici dona QuiritiS,

quo spectanda mod0‚ quo sensu credis et ore?

Qui timet his adversa, fere miratur eodem

quo cupiens pact03 pavor est utrobique molestus; 10
improvisa simul species exterret utriunque.

Gaudeat an doleat, cupiat metuatne, quid ad run,

si quidquid vidit melius peiusque sua spe

defixis oculis animoque et corpore torpet ?

Insani nomen sapiens ferat, aequus iniqui, ,1 15
ultra quam satis est virtutem si petat ipsam.

Ι nunc, argentum et marmor vetus aeraque et artes
suspice, cum gemmis Tyrios mirare colores;

gaude quod spectant oculi te mille loquentem ;

gnavus mane forum et vespertinus pete tectum, ω
