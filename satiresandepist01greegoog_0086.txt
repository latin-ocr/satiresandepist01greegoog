shoulders. Probably it was also

‘ girded up shorter than usual, as is

indicated by succinctam (see Rich,
Dictionary ‘ff A ntiquities).

25. Sagana maiore: there seems
no reason why the natural meaning
of “the elder of two Sagana5,'' both
sorceresses, should not be, taken.
The person is mentioned again in
E pode V. 2 5. — ululantem z repeat-
ing the incantations in a tone suit-
able to the occasion; used regu-
larly of women's cries.—-pallor.
naturally the officiating persons are
frightened also (Epode V. 27).

26. scalpere terram, etc.: the
regular rite in necromancy seems to
have been to dig a ditch and sacri-
fice a blaek sheep into it. This
process was to make the shades
give prophetie answers, which are
also referred to in v. 41, the nature
of which, however, does not appear.
Still we need not expect the story
to be exact about such a matter.
Cf. next note for a similar loose
statement.

27. mordicus: to give the pic·
ture of furies, as it were.

30. lanea: the process here is
often referred to, The two puppets
represent the person secking the
enchantment and the one to be af-
fected, one being subject to the
action of beat, and the other not.
In Virgil (Ecl. VIII. 80) they are

unaffected. — maior· as indicating
superior power and mastery. The
whole implies that whatever the
ffilppet sufferst vzill tlte transferred by

e magic ar o e person repre-
sented. So the symbolism is carried
as far as possible, even to peritura
(suppliciter stabat).

32. servilibus, i ..e die in tor-
ment. Probably in all this two or
three rites are cyonfounded (cf. Vir-

. gil, Ecl. VIII. 80), as also in the fol-

lowing. —serpentis atque canes,
attendants upon Hecate.

3 . rubentem: the moon is com-
i y represented as blushing‚ and
hiding behind the great tombs in
the neighborhood.
