by the want of Roman comedy and by the Greek character
sketches in another direction. In this sense Satire is an
abortive comedy.

The model of Lucilius was exactly followed by Horace, and
the result is these two books of SatireS, which for genial humor
and amusing representation of the vices and follies of mankind,
are unequalled in any literature. From the acute observation
of human nature and social life that they show, and the, felicity
of expression that abounds on every page, they have always
been among the most admired and most quoted wm’ks of
ancient literature. “

The style is always easy and graeefixl 3 never forced nor
affected. They must have been written at a dash, however
much Horace may have trimmed them and filed them after-
wardS. They are never labored, notwithstanding the cane with
which they must have been written, and if an idea attributed to
Horace is far-fetched we may be almost sure it is wrong and

. not Horatian. The difficulties often found in following the

thought are not caused, as in some authorS, by a labored ob-
scurity. They are the natural consequence of a quick seizing
and setting forth of salient points to an audience that could
readily supply the missing links.

The peculiar characteristic of Horace is his genial humor.
He does not inveigh against the vices of mankind, but sets
forth the laughable aspects of their viceS, and constantly in-
cludes himself among the objects of his satire, being in this
respect more like Thackeray than any other author before or

since.

A rclzaisms.—The Satires, in accordance with their colloquial
character, are full of expressions such as were used in com·
mon life, though they had become antiquated or had never
appeared in literature.
