HORATI EPISTVLAE. 173

sponsi Penelopae, nebuloneS, Alcinoique
in cute curanda plus aequo operata iuventuS‚
cui pulchrum fuit in medios dormire dies et . 30
ad strepitum citharae cessantem ducere somnum.
Vt iugulent hominem, surgunt de nocte latrones;
ut te ipsum serveS‚ non expergisceris? Atqui

found in the sels-indulgent Phaea·
cians (Odys. VIII. 11), or in the
riotous suitors of Penelope (Odys.
11. 74 et al.) — numerus (as ἄριθ-
μος in Greek), mere ciphers, per·
sons of no significance except to
swell the number of mankind. —
fruges, etc.: doubtless proverbial
of persons go‘od for nothing else. —
consumere ε poetic (and collo·
quial?) sor ad consumendas.

29. cute curanda: see Sat. 11.
{nis-..xffffizrffsrssanthzi‘30¹¹*

31· ad strepitum: cf. Od. ΙΙΙ.
ι. 20. — cessantem, reluctant, that
does not come when desired on ac·
count of the wantos natural satigue.
Cf. Sat. 11. 2. 80. (Another reading,
cessatum . . . curam, is approved
by many editors.)

32. ut iugulent, etc.: the de-
scription of a sels-indulgent life nat-
urally leads to an exhortation to end
it, and devote one’s sels to the study
of philosophy as a defence against
it. —surguntz i.e. if cut-throats are
willing to rise early to take life, how
much more should one rise early to
save his own, and this rising early

is a beginning of strenuous resist-
ance to sels-indulgence.

33. expergisceris: present for
future, as in the language os com·
edy. —atquiz as if the answer had
been in the negative, the poet pro-
ceeds to argue the point, hence the
adversative. Ι

34. noles sanus: i.e. if you won't
take exercise (another effort against
sels-indulgence) while in good
health, you will be obliged to do so
under the advice of your physician
when, you have become dropsical
through your sloth. Cf. Mullum
ambulandum, currendum aliquid,
CeISUS, III. 21.

35. posces, etc.= if you won’t
wake and fortify yourself against
passion by the study of philosophy,
your passions will keep you awake
all night by and by.

37. nam cur, etc.: i.e. you take
instant measures against bodily ills ς
why do you postpone the cure of
moral affections?

40. dimidium, etc. ε an old prov-

erb. ἀρχὴ ’γὰρ λέγεται μὲν ἥμισυ

παντὸς, κτλ. Plato de Legg. VI.
(cf. the sentiment of Ep. Ι. 1. 28).
