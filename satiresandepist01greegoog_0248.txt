HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm 1.

vestimenta dabat pretiosa: beatus enim iam

cum pulchris tunicis sumet nova consilia et spes,

dormiet in lucem, scorto postponet honestum

officium, nummos alienos pascet, ad imum 35

Thraex erit aut holitoris aget mercede caballum.
Arcanum neque tu scrutaberis illius unquam,

commissumque teges et vino tortus et ira.

Nec tua laudabis studia aut aliena reprendes 3

nec, cum venari volet ille, poemata pangeS. 40

Gratia sic fratrum geminorum, Amphionis atque

Zethi, dissiluit donec suspecta severo

conticuit lyra. fFraternis cessisse putatur

moribus Amphion: tu cede potentis amici

lenibus imperiis, quotiesque educet in agros 45

Aetolis onerata plagis iumenta canesque,

32. beatus iarn, now become a
rich man, i.e. in his tastes and feel-
mgs.

33. sumet: the thought of Eu·
trapelus, he will, said he, etc. —
consilia, plan fflilfe.

35. pascet, wil cultivate.

36. Thraex: cf. Sat. ΙΙ. 6. 44.
— holitoris, a huckster, who car-
ried about vegetables on a horse
or donkey through the streets for
sale. This custom is still common
in Italy, while the corresponding
business is done with us in a wagon.
of course the employment of a
driver of such an animal would be
os the lowest kind. We should say,
dig ditches, or carry mortar.

37. arcanum, etc.= i.e. be not
too inquisitive as to his secrets, not
garrulous as to his confidences.

38. tortus: cf. ΙΙ. 3. 435, a com-
mon idea with the ancients‚ derived
from evidence under torture. — ira,
tle. from some offence taken at the

patron.
39. nee tua laudabis, etc.= i.e.

do not exalt your tastes above his,
but gracefully conform to his favor·
ite pursuits. —alienffi i.e. such as
the patron's.

40. venari, etc.= this advice, ac·
companied by the details which fol-
low, seems not to be merely gen·

. eral, but to have reference to the

pursuics of the unknown patron,
and the liter-ary leanings of Lollius.
shgwinggrthtteasegatssatingassorgffidssrt:
congenial tastes. —- Amphionis: cf.
Od. 111. 1 1. 2.

42. suspecta: the ancienu, with
all their devotion to the Muses,
were inclined to look upon litera-
ture and music as more or less ef·
seminate and frivolous. — severo:
the character of Zethus is repre-
sented as somewhat savage, or at
least serious aud wat-like.

45. lenibus: i.e. only expressed
in gentle invitation.

46. Aetolis: probably in allu-
sion to the chase of the Calydoman
boat. — onerata: cf. Ι. 6. 58.
