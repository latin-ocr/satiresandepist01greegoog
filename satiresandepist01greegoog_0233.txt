HORATI EPISTVLAE. 211

impransus non qui civem dinosceret hoste,

quaelibet in quemvis opprobria fingere saevus, 30
pernicies et tempestas barathrumque macelli,

quidquid quaesierat, ventri donabat avaro.

Hic ubi nequitiae fautoribus et timidis nil

aut paullum abstulerat, patinas cenabat omasi

vilis et agninae, tribus ursis quod satis esset ; 35
scilicet ut ventres lamna candente nepotum

diceret urendos corrector Bestius. Idem

quicquid erat nactus praedae maioriS, ubi omne

‘verterat in fumum et cinerem, ‘ Non Hercule miror,’
aiebat, ‘si qui comedunt bona, cum sit obeso 40
nil melius turdo, nil volva pulchrius ampla.'

²9· civem dinosceret hoste:
apparently proverbial, ready to ac·
cept an invitation from either.

30. opprobria, etc. : i.e. in his
quality as scurra, abusing anybody
to make himself agreeable. Cf. Sat.
1. 4. 86—90, and Ep. I. 18. 11, as
, well as the English word scurrilous
with its developed meaning.

33. nequitiae fautoribus: such
as Hermogenes Tigellius, Sat. I. 2.
1-4. —timidis ε i.e. those who were
afraid of his abuse.

34. abstulerat: i.e. had sailed
to secure any gifts sufficient to en·
able him to, indulge his appetite for
dainties. — patinas, whole platters,
indicating his greediness even when
he had less inviting food than the
luxuries to which he was ordinarily
invited. He did not disdain this
humble food, but enjoyed what he
had to repletion.

36. scilicet ut, et0.: in this lies
the kernel of the whole anecdote.
In time of scarcity he consoled him:
self by becoming a reformer, ,and
venting his abuse upon spendthrifts
wh0‚ it must be remembered, were
the very nequitiae fautores who

fed him. It is this tone of abuse
that Horace represents as corre-
sponding to his own preaching
against the vices of mankind. —
ventres: in allusion to the punish·
ment of slaves, which was made to
fit the crime by branding the offend-
ing member. —lamnaz cf. :grues
candentesque laminae ceterique
cruciatus, Cic. Verr. V. 63.

37. corrector: better than the
Ms. correctus as making a more
exact parallel with Horace. — Bes-

’ tius (in apposition with subject of

diceret) : a contemporary or earlier
inveigher against luxury 3 cf. tem-
erance reformers in modern times.

P

38.. praedae: Horace treats the
Eifflss‘ssssdssffiossss 2¹¹¹0⁵fi¹³32¹13³1¹i1⁵m²35
v. 34. His plunder in this case was
sufficient to gratify his old tasteS, and
atcfordingly he lives in luxury while
1 asts.
th1³s⁹ie1¹1²22ss²k ssz‘sszltffissfi20f2’03ss2
his preaching against extravagance
is lonly ¹a temporary phas& lasting
on so on ashe had no in .

4y1. volvga: considered a ggreat
delicacy by the Romans.
