which must be followed, as being in
accordance with the law.

6. aio, that's what I say.— pere-
am male, consound me ,· cf. 1. 9. 47.

7. erat, would be,· instead of the
subjunctive, on account of the mean-
ing of the phrase (“ necessity, pro-
priety,'' etc.). The expression is
the apodosis contrary to fact of an
omitted protasis, si ita facerem, or
the 1ike; but the whole conditional
sentence, including both protasis
and apodosiS, is the protasis of
peream male in the form where
no opinion is expressed (cf. 1. 9.
38 and 47). — dormire: this word
at once indicates that it is Horace's
nature to write so long as he is
awake‚ thus making it an impera-
tive necessity, and it also gives Hor·
* ace a chance to allude to ,two of
ξ the foibles of Trebatius, swimming
ι and wine—ter, ete.: Trebatius,
taking note of only the final expres-
sion, as if he did not know what it
really meant, gives a prescription
in the brief professional manner,
for insomnia. Tbere is an old super-
stition about this number. — uncti:
the ancients in all their athletic exer·
cises anointed themselves with oil,
partly to render the skin soft, and
partly to prevent the effect of cold.

8. transnanto: this form of the

imperative is in the formal archaic
style of laws and prescriptions.

9. irriguum: tle. drink freely
before going to bed.

10. rapit: i.e. with such force as
to be irresistible. — aude: the dar·
ing would consist in trying so lofty
a theme.

11. Caesaris, τῖε.
though he did not receive this
appellation till B.C. 27, a few years
later. — rea, i.e. his warlike exploits,
in an epic.

12. laturus: we must break this
into another sentence in English,
as we are often obliged to do with
this favorite construction of Horace.
—eupidumz this also should be
made a separate clause. — pater,
venerable sir, a common form of
addi-ess in Latin to older persons.

at the same time he contrives to
give an indirect hint at what he
would say if he tried such themes. —
horrentia, etc.: descriptions which
one must attempt who essays this
form. -pilist z‘.e. the Roman army.

14. fracta cuspide: sometimes
taken as referring to the device by
which the point of a spear was so
