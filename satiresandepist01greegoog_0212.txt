190 HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. Ι.

nec tamen ignorat quid distent aera lupinis,

Dignum praestabo me etiam pro laude merentis.

Quodsi me noles usquam discedere, reddes 25
forte latus, nigros angusta fronte capillos ;

reddes dulce loqui; reddes ridere decorum et

inter vina fugam Cinarae maerere protervae.

Forte per angustam tenuis volpecula rimam

repserat in cumeram frumenti, pastaque rursus 30
ire foras pleno tendebat corpore frustra.

Cui mustela procul : ‘ Si vis,’ ait, ‘effugere istinc,
macra cavum repetes artum, quem macra subist'i.'

Hac ego si compellor imagine, cuncta resigno ;

nec somnum plebis laudo satur altilium, nec 35
otia divitiis Arabum liberrima muto,

Saepe verecundum laudasti, rexque paterque

audisti coram, nec verbo parcius absens;

23. nec tamen, etc.: and yet the
giver knows the value of the gift3
though he gives freely, he makes
something like a sacrifice—lupi·
nis: the regular stage money, used
as children count with beans.

24. dignum, etc.: i.e. Horace
also recognizes the value of the gift,
and will show gratitude in pro·
portion.

25. quodsi, etc.: i.e. yet if the
gift is ‘to constitute a claim to inces-
sant attendance, the poet must have

. back his lost youth, whose vigor

made such attendance possible.
This, of course, cannot be, and he
proceeds by the use of a fable to
assert delicately that he cannot by
any munificence be bound to lose
his independence, and would rather
resign all than be fattened as a
humble dependent, or be forced to
activity against his will.

27. dulce loqui: cf. Od. I. 22. 23.
The inf. as a noun is colloquial.

28. Cinarae: cf. Od. IV. 1. 33
IV. ¹3· 22; Epist. Ι. 14. 32.

29. volpecula: the substitution
of nitedula (Bentley) is unneces· ,
sary, inasmuch as old fables are
often regardless of natural history.
Cf. The F ox and the Grapes.

34. si compellet, etc.: i.e. if ·
your demands are to be understood
in the sense of the remark of the
weasel, Ι give up all your gifts.

35. somnum: i.e. the idleness of
a mere pampered dependent.

36. otia, etc.: i.e. the freedom
to pursue my own vocations unin-
terrupted. ,

37. saepe verecundum, etc.:
i.e. yet from my former conduct you
can see how much it would cost me
to give up this relation3 but Ι value
my independence more, and would

' abandon the gift if it brings obliga·

tions for which I am unfitted‚ and
so becomes an unsuitable gift, like
horses to Telemachus—verecun-
dum : modest and respectful, show-
ing that his present attitude is not
a mere wilful impertinence, ot the
arrogance of a spoilt favorite.
