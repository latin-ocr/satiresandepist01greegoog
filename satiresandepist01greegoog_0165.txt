aedibus ex magnis subito se conderet, unde

mundior exiret vix libertinus honeste;

iam moechus Romae, iam mallet doctus Athenis·
vivere, Vertumnis quotquot sunt natus iniquis,

Scurra VolaneriuS‚ postquam illi iusta cheragra 15
contudit articuIOS, qui pro se tolleret atque

mitteret in phimum taloS‚ mercede diurna

conductum pavit ; quanto constantior isdem

in vitiis, tanto levius miser ac prior illo,

qui iarn content0‚ iam laxo fune laborat. 20
H. Non dices hodie quorsum haec tam putida tendant,
furcifer? D. Ad te, inquam. H. Quo pacm, pessime?

D. Laudas

fortunam et mores antiquae plebis, et idem,
si quis ad illa deus subito te agat, usque recuseS,

12. mundior, respectable ,· i.e. of
the better class. — honeste, with
decency.

13. doctus, a philosopher.

14. Vertumnis: there was prop·
erly only one god of this name, the
god of the changing seasom. The
poet, however, jocosely multiplies
the number, and represents them as
having given him at his birth all
their fickleness to his injury.

15. Volanerius: an example of
persistence. — iusta, well earned,
by excesses at the table, which he
frequented as scurra, or professional
diner·out.

16. contudit ε i.e.- so that he
‘could no longer do the service for
himself. —se : the reflexive allowed
because the clause is a purpose of
the man.

17. talos, the knuckle-bones, used
by the ancients as well as dice for
gaming.

18. conductum, etc.: indicating
lkiis devotion to the game. — pavit,

ept.

19. levius ,miser ε the slave

makes the consistently vicious man ‘
the better off of the two,
. 20. contento, etc.: the figure
probably derived from leading an
animal, whose attempts to get free
only trouble-it the more.

21. hodie : not in the literal
sense, but as in the comedy in its
weakest use, now.—- quorsum . . .
tendunt, what . . . is driving at,
the regular expression (often with
tendere omitted) for asking the
meaning of an argument. —putida,
silly stuff.

22. ad te, at you, the slave taking
the quorsum in a different sense,
and so bringing the argument home
in Horace’s usual manner, as he
proceeds to explain in the next
verse.—laudas: cf. 11. 6. 60. It
is characteristic of Horace that this
reproach should be selected, which
is in the main true (cf. Ep. I. 8. 12).

23. fortunam, condition, in re-
gard to their mode of life.

24. usque, ‘⁴ every time.”
