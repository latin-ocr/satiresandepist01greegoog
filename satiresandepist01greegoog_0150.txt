HORATI SERMONES.

[L113. 11.

abnuere et tabulas a te removere mement0‚
sic tamen, ut limis rapiaS, quid prima secundo
cera velit versu3 solus multisne coheres,

veloci percurre oculo.

Plerumque recoctus 55

scriba ex quinquevirqcorvum deludet hiantem,
captatorque dabit risus Nasica Coran0.

Ulzlv. Num furis ? an prudens ludis me obscura canendo?
χ T ir. O Laertiade, quicquid dicam aut erit aut non ε
divinare etenim magnus mihi donat Apollo. 60
Ulix. Quid tamen ista velit sibi fabula, si licet, ede.

· T ir. Tempore quo iuvenis Parthis horrenduS, ab alto
demissum genus Aenea, tellure marique

52. abnuere, etc.= to show the¹
disinterestedness of his devotion.

53. sic tamen, ete: i.e. but do

not fail to assure yourself that you
are not taken in yourself. —prima
. . . cera: the first of the two tablets
on which such documents were writ-
ten. Cf. note on Ι. 6. 74.— se·
cundo ·. . . versu: the first line
would have the testator's name; the
second, the heir'S.
...a ὴίξζὲἑὲῗὲἑ ῗιξὲ· ξεὲὲέιὲἱ ἓξὲξ
through the wiles of the will-hunter
and finally eludes him. This idea,
however, is jocosely expressed by
reference to a single instance where
such a thing has happened. As the
incident has happened since the
time of Ulysses, the whole is put in
the form of a prophecy, keeping up
the form of the travesty, and produ·
cing a most comic effect. —recoc·
tua, boiled dowu ,· an allusion to the
story of Medea, which had become
almost proverbial. Cf. Cic. de Sen.
XXIII. 83.

56. scriba: cf. 11. 6. 36.—quin·
queviro: apparently a kind of
policeman. Cf. Cic. Acad. 11. 44.
136, though boards of five men for
several other purposes are men·

tioned. At any rate, the office is
that of some humble magistrate. —
corvum: an allusion to the fable
of the fox and the crOW.

58. num furis: the use of the
proper nameS, unknown of course
to UlysseS, makes him doubt the
sanity of the seer. -- prudenS, pur·
posely, as opposed to furis.

59. O Laertiade: the seer replies

. in effect that the allusion is a pro-

phetie one.- aut erit aut non:
this would naturally mean, will or
will not according as I say it will
or will not, but no doubt there is
a double meaning, with a jest at
divination.

60. divinare: a poetic use of the
infinitive probably influenced by the
Greek. -— donat: present because
the gift is a continued one.

61. tamen: as if he said, “yes,
but still I wish you would explain
what the story means.'’

62. ternpore, etc.: purposely put
in the heroic style. The time re-
ferred to is the establishment of
Augustus' power after the battle
of Actium.

63. demissutm cf. Virg. AEn. 1.
288.—genus, a scion, in appo·
sition with iuvenis. Cf. 1. 6. 12.
