frater: apparently equivalent to an
adjective, or to talis frater. It has
been suggested that a line has been
lost, uterque Alterius laudum sic
admirator, εἴας but it is danger·
ous to rewrite Horace even to avoid
a harsh construction.

88. meros honores, nothing but
tribules ofpraise.

89. Gracchus ε both Tiberius
and Gaius were samed as oratorS.
—Muciusz the Mucius Scaevola
faffiily was famous for its lawyers·

90. qui minus argutos, etc.:
i.e. the same craze of mutual ad-
miration¹ possesses the poets. For
the phrase, cf. Sat. II. 3. 311.—
argutos, tuneful. Cf. Od. ΙΙΙ. 14.
213 IV. 6. 25. An epithet almost
ornamental, but referring to the
poets as opposed to the practical
men of the two political professions
in which puffing might be excused.
Cf. the references to the poetica]
elique in Sat. I. 10.

91. earmina: cf. v. 99.—ele-
gos: cf. v. 100.

92. caelatum, wrought, as if the
work were in silver. — adspice:
tle. first notice our important air,

opposed to sequere, etc„ v. 95.

93. fastu . . . molimine, a proua'

and pompous aira—circumspecte-
mus: in Homer, who dates back to
a time when the prepositions were

still adverbs, and had not yet be-
come attached to the verbs at all,
they are frequently found separated
even by several wordS. In later
times this usage was thought to be
a poetical figure, and was imitated
or allowed as such, so that in Latin,
in which the prepositions ·had long
been firmly attached, they are some-
times found divided as here. Cf.
the cere— comminuit— hrum of
Ennius. The word refers to the air
of the poets as they survey the tem·

ple in which they are to recite for ·

each other's delectation.

96. quid ferat, etc„ what each
has to qffer, i.e. what tribute of
praise each brings. For an exam-
ple, though of a later time, cf.

Dum centum studet auribus virorum

hoc quod saecula posterique sint
