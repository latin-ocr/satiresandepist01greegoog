HORATI SERMONES. 135

Maia nate, nisi ut propria haec mihi munera faxis 5
Si neque maiorem feci ratione mala rem,
nec surn facturus vitio culpave minorem ;

si veneror stultus nihil horum:

‘ O si angulus ille

proximus accedat, qui nunc denormat agellum l

O si urnam argenti fors quae mihi monstret, ut illi, ιο
thesauro invento qui mercennarius agruni

illurn ipsum mercatus aravit, dives amico

Hercule !' si quod adest gratum iuvat, hac prece te oro:
pingue pecus domino facias et cetera praeter

ingenium, utque soles, custos mihi maximus adsis! 15

auctius: more generously, a rare
adverb, but in accordance with the
meaning of auetuS, abundant.

5. Maia natet Mercury, as the
god of gain, cf. 11. 3. 68; but cf.
also v. 15 with Od. ΙΙ. 17. 29, and
11. 7. 13.—propria= cf. ΙΙ. 2. 129,
and Ep. ΙΙ. 2. 172.—faxis: this
use of the perfect for the pres-
ent seems to be colloquial and ar-
chaic, as certainly the use of the
short form is.

6. si: introducing the protasis of
oro, v. 13, a common form of sup·
plication m ancient times, Cf.‘
we forgive those,'’ etc„ od. ΙΙΙ. 18.
ξς tumeam εἴποτέ τοι χαρίεντ’ ἐπὶ
νηὸν ἔρεψα, Hom. Il. Ι. 39.- rna·
iorem, ete: cf. Ι. 4. 108.—ratione
mala, any base means prompted by
avarice. This is spoken of in the
past because the poet takes the pres·
ent condition of his estate as the
starting point.

7. sum facturus», etc.: i. e. have
no bad habits of luxury (vitio) to
waste, nor idleness (eulpa) to neg·
lect, and so lose my property· These
are spoken of as to their future re·

. sults. ΤΙιε whole claims the favor

of the god on account of past vir-
tues and present character.
8. veneror: i.e. pray for in my

worship of the gods. Cf. 11. 2. 124 ;

and qui multa deos venerati sunt
contra eius salutem, Cic. ad Fam,
VI. 7.—stultu8: i.e. as covetous,
and so not a sapiens, who would
have no vain desires. — nihil ho·
rum, nothing like this.

10. urnam argenti: the ancients
on account of the insecure state of
society were often wont to bury
their treasure, and at times to lose
it. Cf. Plaut. Aulularia and nec
vero quemquam senem audivi obli·
tum quo loco thesaurum obruisset,
Cic. de Sen. 21.

11. qui mercennarius: a short-
hand way of saying qui agrum, quem
mercennarius araverat, mercatus
(and so the owner) aravit. This
compendious form seems colloquial
like so many other expressions in
the Satires.

13 Hercule: regarded asa givet
of gain (πλουτοδότης), especially
from hidden treasures.— gratum,
my grateful soul, i. e. if Ι am satis-
fied and thankful.

14. pingue, keavy (to render the
punning force of the word as a'p-
plied to ingenium), dull, thick. —
cetera, all the rest.

¹5· ut soles: cf. 0d.11.17.29,
and Od. ΙΙ. 7. 13. Mercury being
