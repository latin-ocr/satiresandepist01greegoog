HORATI EPISTVLAE. 263

quae poterunt unquam satis expurgare cicutae,

ni melius dormire putem quam scribere versus?

Singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes: 55
eripuere iocoS, venerem, convivia, ludum 3

tendunt extorquere poemata: quid faciam vis?

Denique non omnes eadem mirantur amantque:
carmine tu gaudeS‚ hic delectatur iambiS,

ille Bioneis sermonibus et sale nigro, 60
Tres mihi convivae prope dissentire videntur,

poscentes vario multum diversa palat0.

Quid dem? Quid non dem ? Renuis tu quod iubet alter ;
quod petis, id sane est invisum acidumque duobus

there is no reason to believe that he
ever wrote for money. But disap-
pointed in his first hopes of advance-
ment, and having had a taste of
life with the great, he must seek a
career, and was forced to this one.
His success in this is his desperate
storming of the royal sortress. — sed
quod, εἴας i.e. he has now won
his decorations and booty‚ and, like
the rustic soldier, fights no more.—
quod: equivalent to tantum ut
with the verb impersonal, wherewith
to keep from want.

ῐοηῗὲἑ ἓιῖζῗᾞοῑῗέξὲἷίιὲῗὲᾟὲῗιέζὲ
not give over writing. — cicutae:
apparently used as a remedy, like
ῗᾋῶἳῖῗῗὲαέὲῗῗὶ fas· ζῗχίὲῗ
- gerandum stomachum malagma,
Pliny, Ν. H. XXV. 153 (95).

5 5. singula de nobie, etc.: an·
other reason why Horace does not
write. — singula praedantur, take
each its prey.

56. eripuere: these they have
already stolen. —ludum ς used gen-
erally of all amusements which re·
quire youthful spirits for their enjoy-
ment, but especially poetry.

57. tendunt ς τῖε. having de-

stroyed other capacitieS, they have
begun to attack his creative power
in poetry. —extorquerez appar·
ently indicating that this capacity
dies hard, but still it is doomed.—
quid faciam vis: que vaula-vous?
a submission to the inevitable.

58. denique, etc-z another ‚ex-
cuse (rather than reason) is that he
cannot satisfy all tasteS, and so does
nothing.

59. carmine: i.e. odes.—iam·
bis: i.e. epodes.

60. ine, etc.: i.e. satires.— Bi-
oneis: Bion was a Scythian phi-
losopher of caustic wit and cynical
disposition, who lived about Rc, 2 50.
Cfi'Hv δὲ καὶ θεατρικὸς καὶ πολὺς ἐν
τῷ ’γελοίῳ διαφορῆσαι, φορτικοῖς ὀνό-
μασιν κατὰ τῶν πραγμάτων χρώμενος,
Diog. Laert. IV. 7. 5. —sale nigro:
as wit is common salt (cf. Sat. I. 10.
3), this kind is caustic potash (cs.
Sat. ΙΙ. 4. 74).

61. prope, almost like, the figure
and the object being identified as
usual.

63. quid dem, etc.: keeping up
the figure to the end; ‘ whatever Ι
affl will be distasteful to two out
o ee.’
