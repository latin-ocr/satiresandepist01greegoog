Si quis

forte coheredum senior male tussiet, huic tu
die, ex parte tua seu fundi sive domus sit
emptor, gaudentem nummo te addicere. —- Sed me

imperiosa trahit Proserpina: vive valeque!

SATIRE 6. This Satire combinoe
a cry of the beart against the wor-
ries of the city and raises of the
delights of country li e, with a deli·
cate expression of thanks to Mae·
cenas for his gift of the Sabine farm,
which has enabled Horace to satisfy
his craving. Τὴε fable of the city
and the country mouse ingeniously
introduced gracefully repeats the
same general theme.

1. hoc: referring to the follow·
ing. For the spirit of the expres-
sion of satisfaction, cf. od. 11. 18.

11. 13. 2. ——.modus: i.e. a moderate
amount.—ita: cf. ΙΙ. 2. 46.

2. iugis: either with aquae or
fons. The latter would follow the
favorite interlocked order, but cf.
Ep. I. 15. 16.

3. super his, in addition to this,-
in prose it would be accusative.—
