Serus enim Graecis admovit acumina chartiS,

in so far as he produced a continu·
ous work, was a native os Tarentum,
and was brought to Rome as a slave
by M. Livius Salinator. All his
works were translations from the
Greek. His first play was presented
B.c. 240. Cf. Livy VII. 23 Cic.
Brut. 723 de Sen. 50. Naevius
(B.C. 235) was a citlzen of Cam·
pania, but mostly followed Greek
originals. Plautus (born B.C. 254)

planted by the hexameter. It was
a rude kind of iambic catalectic
septenariuS‚ with occasional omis·
sion of the arsis (which alone to
Horace's ear would make it horri-
dus), and occasional accented short
theses. Cf. Naevius’ epitaph at-
tributed to himself:

Immbmles mort-‘tles si soret sas flere, etc.:
and his epigram on the Metelli:

Fato Metelli Romal siunt consules:
also:

Terra pestem teneto salus hic maneto.
—Varro, R. R. 1. 2. 27.

provement in elegant manners.

163. Thespis: loosely used of
the supposed earliest playwright.

164. temptavit, etc. ε i.e. he began
to study (v. 161) and then tried also
to imitate. —rem, tlte matter, i.e.
disregarding the style3 another rea·
son sor v. 160. — vertere, repro-
duce, a little more than translate.

16 . placuit sibi: i.e. he was
satis ed with his efforts, and did
well enough, saving the exception
in v. 167.—natura, etc.: i.e. the
Roman, from-his serious nature, was
well fitted for forms of composition
requiring strength and intensity.

166. spirat tragicum (cognate
accusative), lte breatlzes the tragic
style. Cf. spirantes bellum, Lucr. V.
