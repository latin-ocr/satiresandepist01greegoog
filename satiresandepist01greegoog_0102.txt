Valgius, et probet haec Octavius,- optimus atque
FuscuS, et haec utinam ,Viscorum laudet uterque!
Ambitione relegata te dicere possum,

Pollio, te, Messalla, tuo cum fratre, simulque 85
VOS, Bibule et Servi, simul his te, candide Furni,
compluris alios, doctos ego quos et amicos

prudens praetere03 quibus haee, sunt qualiacumque,
arridere velim, doliturus si placeant spe

deterius nostra. Demetri, teque, Tigelli, 90
discipularum inter iubeo plorare cathedras.

·“ I, puer, atque meo citus haec subscribe libello.

82. Valgius, C. Valgius Rufus,
an elegiae and epigrammatic poet, a
friend of Horace, to whom Od. 11.
9 is addressed. His writings are
now lost.— OctaviuS, a poet and
historian. Virgil(?) speaks ,of him,
Catalecta XIV„-

, “ Scri ῳ quidem tua nos multum mira-

Raptumugtul-Zgintgnam flebimus historiam.”

83. Fuscus: see Ι. 9. 61, Od. Ι.
22, Ep. Ι. 10. He was probably
only a literary connoisseur, as no
works of his are known to us—

* Viscorum, one of them is men—

tioned in 1. 9. 22, but they are
otherwise unknown.

84. ambitione: as the others
were of high rank in prominent
positions, he might be accused of am-
bitious designs in mentioning them ;
therefore he declares that he has no
such designS, and implies that their
prominence is so great that he can
mention them without suspicion.

85. Pollio: see v. 42.— Mes-
salla: see v. 29.— fratre, Pedius.

86. Bibule, Servi, Furni: oth-
erwise unknown—his: dative fol-

lowing simul by an imitation of
the Greek ἅμα and an extension of

words of nearness and likeness.

87. doctos, comeoisseurs,· cf. v.
52 and 1. 9. 7.

88. prudens, purposely: cf. im-
prudens. — haec, the Satires, to
which this one is a kind of envoi. —
qualiacumque, such as they are.

89. arridere, give phasan, a
meaning transferred from its proper
meaning of smile upon. Cf. Cic. ad
Att. ΧῙῙῙ. 21. 3.— doliturus: afa-
vorite construction with Horace, but
better rendered in English by and
I should, etc.

90. deterius, being applied to a
good thing, is equivalent to minus,
and is very likely colloquial.

91. discipularum: by this word
Horace scoffs at these poets as
effeminate women's darlings. — iu-
beo: the regular word, like our bid,
here with a kind of double meaning.
—plorare, whine, referring to the

love-sick songs that these men sang ·

(and perhaps taught also), to the de·
light of women, and also to the Greek
οἶμῶζειν (the opposite of χαίρειν).

sse whole only amounts to, “ 1

leave you to whine among your pet-
ticoated pupils, bad luck to you.''

92. puer: an amanuensis. - ci-
tus t adjective for adverb ; ‘⁴ be
quick and go.''— libello: the first
book of Satires.
