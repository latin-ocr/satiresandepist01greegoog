HORATI EPISTVLAE. [Lm. 11. ιιι. 463-476.]

servari nolit ?’ dicam, Siculique poetae

narrabo interitum.

‘ Deus immortalis haberi

dum cupit EmpedocleS, ardentem frigidus Aetnam 455

insiluit.

Sit ius liceatque perire poetis,

Invitum qui servat, idem facit occidenti.

N ec semel hoc fecit, nec, si retractus erit, iarn

fiet homo et ponet famosae mortis amorem.

Nec satis apparet, cur versus factitet ; utrum 470
minxerit in patrios cineres, an triste bidental

moverit incestus: certe furit, ac velut ursus

obiectos caveae valuit si frangere clatroS,

indoctum doctumque fugat recitator acerbus ;

quem vero arripuit, tenet occiditque legendO, 475
non missura cutem, nisi plena cruoriS, hirud0.’

463. Siculique poetae: Empe-
docles who, according to the story
which Horace gives, threw himself
into the crater of AEtna iu order to
disappear miraculously.

465. dum cupit, etc.: cf.1. 2.
21 and note. —frigidusz a grim
joke. Empedocles is called cold as
opposed to the fire of AEtna, imply-
ing that his act was done without
excitement, in cold blood; cf. the

uses os calidus,
46 . idem: i.e. just as much, an

equ outrage. — occidenti, gov-
erned by idem, in imitation of a

Greek construction. This is the
only spondaic verse in Horace.

468. nec semel, etc.: i. e. this
isn't the first time, and in a con-
firmed case there is no hope of his
recovery; ‘he is joined to his idols,
let him alone!

470. nec satis, etc.: i. e. we can-
not account for 'his madness, it is
true, but he is certainly raving, and
is avoided by everybody just as if
he were a wild animal. If, how-
ever, he catches anybody, he sticks
to him like a leech. So with this
jocose view of the poetic crazc Hor·
ace closes the epistle.
