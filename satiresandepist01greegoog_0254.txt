HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. Ι.

Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus Homerus ;
Ennius ipse pater nunquam nisi potus ad arma

prosiluit dicenda.

‘Forum Putealque Libonis

mandabo sicciS, adimam cantare severis!

Hoc simul edixi, non cessavere poetae ιο
nocturno certare mem, putere diurn0.

Quid si quis vultu torvo ferus et pede nudo
exiguaeque-togae· simulet textore Catonem, - . .
virtutemne repraesentet moresque Catonis?

Rupit Iarbitam Timagenis aemula lingua, 15 ’
dum studet urbanus tenditque disertus haberi.
Decipit exemplar vitiis imitabile. Quodsi

6. laudibus: cf„ among other
passages, Il. VI. 260. — vinosus, a
wine-drinker, producing his poetry
under that stimulus, .’

7. EnniuS, etc.: the chief evi-
dence of the statement is the fact
that Ennius suffered from the gout.

8. prosiluit: as if he himself
were the ‘warrior he describes, —
Forum, etc. : i.e. the sober business
of life to the exclusion of poetry. —
Puteal: a famous locality in ‘the
Forum, frequented by the money-
lende'rS. Cf. Sat. ΙΙ. 6. 35.

10. hoc simul edixi, as soon as
I have laid down this law, like a
praetor administering justice. — non
cessavere: the poet gradually ap·
proaches the turn which he means
to make. (As soon as Ι have thus
maintained that oets are given to
wine-drinking, alp those who desire
to be poets adopt the practice of
wine—bibbing.)

12. quid si quis, etc.: i.e. but
is it sufficient to copy extet-nal habits
or garb in order to reproduce an
inward nature? Obviously not, and
this brings the poet to the point he
is aiming at. This point he brings
out by an example where an un-

known Iarbitas was ruined by imi-
tating the caustic wit of a man of
geniuS, thinking thereby to be like
his model. —— ferus, rougk, as not
polished by culture. -— pede nudo:
i.e. in the old rough style of early
republican times.

13. exiguae: the early republi-
can Romans wore the toga in scanty
folds and closely bound around the
body (cf. Ῑ. 18. 30), while the im-
perial style became more and more
flowing. — textore: an ablative of
means in the same construction ,as
vultu. The weaver is treated as one
of the means. - Catonem: prob-J
ably the Elder.

15. Timagenis (genitive with
aemula) : a historian from Alexan-
dria who acted as a teacher in the
house of Augustus, He was famous
for his unbridled tongue. Cf. Sen.
de Ira, III. 23.

16. urbanuS, a wit: cf. Sat. I.
10. 65. - disertus, a master of
st Ie.

γι 7. decipit: i.e. in that we mis·
take the faults of a great man for
the real causes of his greatness‚ and
spa 1³{f'cee‘} to imitate them. —vitiis :
a a we ο tespec .
