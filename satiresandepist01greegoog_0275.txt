HORATI EPISTVLAE.

253

captivum portatur ebur, captiva Corinthus.

Si foret in terris, rideret Democritus, seu

diversum confusa genus panthera camelo, 195
sive elephas albus volgi converteret ora ;

spectarqt populum ludis attentius ipsis

ut sibi praebentem mimo spectacula plura,

scriptores autem narrare putaret asello

fabellam surdo,

Nam quae pervincere voces

evaluere sonum, referunt quern nostra theatra ?
Garganum mugire putes nemus aut mare Tuscum ε
tanto cum strepitu ludi spectantur et artes

divitiaeque peregrinae! Quibus oblitus actor

cum stetit in scaena, concurrit dextera laevae. 205

tions of towns, rivers, and the like,
were borne in processioa, and it
may be that models of ships were
also carried.

193. ebu‘r: cf. tulit (L. Scipio)
in triumpho eburneos dentes mille
ducentos triginta unum. Liv.
XXXVII. 59 — captiva Corinthus,
all the spoils of Corinth, i.e. as much
Corinthian bronze as ever came from
Corinth,when captured by Mummius.

194. rideret Democritus: there
was a popular notion that this phi·
losopher was constantly laughing at
the vicissitudes as well as follies of
mankind, to such a degree that his
fellow·citizens thought him crazy.
The origin of this notion it is im·
possible to trace, but there is found
among the writings of Hippocrates
a spurious letter to Damagetus (No.
17), written probably as early as
the first century B.c., describing this
condition of the philosopher. This
must have been founded on some
previously existing notion of the

ind, and probably served to crys-
tallize it. Cf. Juv. X. 28—53. See
also Burton's Anatomy os Melan-
choly, Introduction.

195. diversum, etc„ the hybrid
creature panther confused with
camel, i.e. the camelopard, or , gi·
raffe, brought to Rome by Julius
Caesar, B.C. 46, to grace the Ludi
Circenses held at his triumph. ——
genus: apposition3 but cf. sus·
pensi loculos, Sat. Ι. 6. 74.

196. elephas albus: then as
now a rarity.

198. ut sibi, etc.: i.e. he, in ac-
cordance with his reputed habit,
would be more amused by the folly
of the spectators than by the player.

199. scriptores, etc.: the state·
ment of the oint he is aiming at,
that authors ave little encourage·
ment to write for such a public. —
asello, etc.: a curious combination
of two proverbs, surdo narrare fa-
hulam and ὄνῳ τις ἔλεγε μῦθον, ὀ δὲ
τὰ ὦτα. ἐκίνει. ZenobiuS, V. 42.

. 200. pervincere, overpower.

201. evaluere: cf. the gnomic
perfect.

202. Garganum: cf. Od. 11. 9. .

203. artes, works of art (as often3, ·
such as statues and vases, which
were carried in the triumphal pro-
cessions referred to in v. 191 seq.
