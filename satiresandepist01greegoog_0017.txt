INTRODUCHON. vii

This kind of literature, which is almost entirely, if not
entirely, Roman (Satura quidem tota nostra est, Quint. X.
1·. 93), had not originally the same meaning that satire has
at present. Its real meaning is “ miscellany ’' (cf. lanx sa-
tura, lex satura), and it was first used, so far as we know,
by Ennius (ac. 239-169) to describe a collection of -versex ³
with mixed metres as well as mixed subjects. This mean-
ing was also followed by PacuviuS, his nephew, and later by
M. Terentius Varro, the great antiquarian, a contemporary of
Cicero, LuciliuS, in the time of Africanus the Younger, used
the word to denote a series of pictures of life and manners in
verse (generally hexameter), more nearly, though not entirely,
in the style which we now call satirical. His satireS, of which
we have fragment5‚ consist of scenes and character sketches
from life, and are generally, though not alwayS, aimed at the
folly and wickedness of mankind, particularly as found in the
party opposed to the elique of Scipio and his friends, The exact
connection of Lucilius’ efforts with Greek models is not clear.
In Horace’s time there seems to have been no idea that there
was any immediate connection with anything Greek except a
remote one with the Old Comedy. Some of the writings of
Ennius may have suggested the development that Lucilius gave
to satire. There was evidently also among the Romans a strong
tendency towards dramatic composition of a lighter kind, as is
indicated by the F escennine and Atellane farceS. There was
also a strong tendency to “ convicia,’' or personal abuse in con-
versational form, “ chaffing,” or “ Billingsgate.’' There were
also extant at that time some compositions in Greek called
Σίλλοι, which seem to have been poetical semidramatic char-
acter sketcheS, something like the prose writings of Lucian.
These Sillae· may have given a suggestion to Ennius and Lucil·
ius; and as the comedy which would naturally have sprung
from all these seeds was crowded out by the translation of
