cruribus haec metuat, doti deprensa, egomet mi.

Omnibus hoc vitium est cantoribuS‚ inter amicos
ut numquam inducant animum cantare rogati,

iniussi numquam desistant.

ille Tigellius hoc.

131. cruribus: for heinous of·
fences‚ such as this treachery to her
master would be, slaves had their
legs broken on an anvil. — depren-
sa: the woman, who in such a case
lost a part of her marriage por-
tion.

133. denique, at any rate, even
if he escapes the other missortunes.

134. Fabio, no doubt the same
philosopher mentioned in I. 1. 14,
according to whose doctrine, of
course as a Stoic‚ nothing was mis-
erum to the sage. Yet even he

ould have to admit that this was.

e abrupt ending after the climax
sin deprendi, etc„ is in Horace’s

avorite manner. However far he

ay go, he stops unexpectedly,
oubtless on purpose to avoid the
ppearance of formal preaching.

SATIRE 3. This satire is directed
against the fault of censoriousness
and the habit of detraction and dis-
paragement os one's friends, These
vices had probably increased, as
often happenS, with the increase of
refinement and the scarcity of other
objects on which to exercise men's
critical faculties. Hor e evidently
saw that they were al to the
social intercourse of a court, and
found them the more hurtful in that
they were practised in a Pharisaic

spirit under the pretence of virtue.
Hence the precepts of this satire.
Here again the poet advanceS, not
directly, but by a flank attack,
starting off with a diatribe against a
member of the court circle now
dead, as if he himself were one os
the detractorS. Presently, however,
he shows that what he has said is
only an example of the disparage-
ment which he wishes to inveigh
a ainst.

gl. The poet begins with a general
charge, but the emphatic position
of omnibus shows that the stricture
is supposed to be intended for some
particular person to be mentioned
later.

3. iniussi, unbidden, uninvited.
— Sardus: the word may well be
supposed to have a disparaging
tone, as the Sardinians were not
much esteemed at Rome.

4. Tigellius: the same person who
is mentioned in the second satire. —
Caesar: Augustus.— posset, etc.:
these subjunctives are not in the
contrary-to-fact construction, but
stand sor present tenses transferred
to past time. If we imagine them
used of a case in the present, their
true character is easily seen. pos·
set, in any case, comes under the
characteristic class· See A. δε G.
