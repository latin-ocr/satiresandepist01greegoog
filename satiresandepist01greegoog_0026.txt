6 HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. 1.

non tuus hoc capiet venter plus ac meus ε ut si
reticulum panis venalis inter onusto
forte vehas umer0, nihilo plus accipias quam

qui nil portarit.

Vel dic, quid referat intra

naturae finis viventi, iugera centum an 50
mille aret? ‘At suave est ex magno tollere acervo,¹
Dum ex parvo nobis tantundem haurire relinquaS,

cur tua plus laudes cumeris granaria nostris?

ut tibi si sit opus liquidi non amplius urna,

vel cyath0, et dicaS, ‘ Magno de flumine mallem 55

quam ex hoc fonticulo tantundem sumere.'

Eo fit,

plenior ut si quos delectet copia iust0,

cum ripa ‘simul avolsos ferat Aufidus acer;

at qui tantuli eget quanto est opuS‚ is neque limo
turbatam haurit aquam, neque vitam amittit in undis. 60

by making a hard clay floor in thev

open air, and treading out the grain
with cattle, —a method which is
still used in Greece and Italy. —
milia, τῖε. modium, pecks‚· but we
may translate bushels

46. ac, llum, an archaic use pre·

fserved in poetry and conversation.
—- ut si, just as, ἰῇ i.e. though you
have the trouble of taking care
of your great crop‚ you can't enjoy
any more than the rest ; just as the
slave who happens to be carrying
the rations in a train gets no more
than his share, for all that.

47. venalis, a gang o slaves.

49. referat: notice t e re, from
refert, not refero.

50. finiS, the limits which nature
sets to our wants. — viventi, the
usual construction is genitive, but it
may be that the colloquial or popuss
lar construction was dative.

51. at suave est, but it is so
sweet, etc.; the miser's reply.

52. relinquas nobis, let me draw.
Cf. Eng. leave in “leave me be.”

53. cumeris, baskets‚· opposed

to the greater store implied in gra-
nana.

54. urna, a measure of three
gallonS‚ a jan—cyatho, also a
measure, of about a twelfth of a
pint, a spoonsul.

55. mallem: this reading is per·
haps preferable to malim, inasmuch
as hoc seems to indicate that the
person supposed has the spring to
draw from but not the river; hence
the construction might naturally be
contrary to fact.

56. eo, in that way, i.e. on ac·
count of this desire to take from a
great quantity.

57. si quos delectet, whoever
takes pleasure in, etc. The state-
mentis a kind of parable continu-
ing the case supposed in v. 54.

58. Aufidus: Horace as usual
takes a particular river, the one near
his birthplace, to represent any.
rapid stream.

60. turbatam, turbid: but also
of life, unquiet.—vitam: implying
that riches are likely to be one’s
rum.
