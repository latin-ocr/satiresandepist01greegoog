HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. ΙΙ.

Si quis emat citharaS, emptas comportet in unum,

nec studio citharae nec musae deditus ulli, 105
si scalpra et formas non sutor, nautica vela

aversus mercaturiS‚ delirus et amens

undique dicatur merit0.

Qui discrepat istis
‘x qui nummos aurumque recondit, nescius uti
compositiS‚ metuensque velut contingere sacrum?

110

Si quis ad ingentem frumenti semper acervum
porrectus ,vigilet cum longo fuste, neque illinc

audeat esuriens dominus contingere granum,

ac potius soliis parcus vescatur amaris ;

si positis intus Chii veterisque Falerni 115
mille cadis —nihil est, tercentum milibus —acre

potet acetum ; age, si et stramentis incubet, unde-
octoginta annos natuS‚ cui stragula vestiS,

blattarum ac tinearum epulae, putrescat in arca:
nimirum insanus paucis videatur, eo quod {2⁰
maxima pars hominum morbo iactatur eodem.

Filius aut etiam haec libertus ut ebibat hereS‚

dis inimice senex, custodis?

Ne tibi desit?

Quantulum enim summae curtabit quisque dierum,

proves nothing, because one question
(litem) is not solved by introdu-
cing another3 namely‚ whether he
was not insane also. Still Horace
has gained the opportunity to crit-
icise the other extreme, which was
what he wanted. He now turns to
' an example about which there can
be no doubt, of a man collecting
things which he can't use, which is
really the miset-'s case.

105. musae, branch os music.

106. non sutor, not beinga shoe-
maker.

108. qui discrepat: how, τῖε.
not at all, for the miser is just like
the cases supposed.

110. sacrum: which it would be
sacrilege to use. Cf. Ι. 3. 71.

113. esuriens dominuS, though
starving, and the owner.

120. nimirum, etc.: the pre-
ceding has prepared us to expect
the natural conclusion, ‘⁴ He would
seem insane to everybody‚’' but this
is changed to the idea in the text,
to show more clearly that this in-
sanity is· an almost universal one.

121. iactatur, is suffering, prop-
erly of a sever.

123. dis inimice, God-sorsaken.
The poet changes to a direct appeal
to the miser himself, and' shows the
folly of his course.
