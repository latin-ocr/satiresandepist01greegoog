HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 11.

crescere res posset, minui damnosa libido.
Mutavit mentem populus levis et calet uno
scribendi studio; puerique patresque severi
fronde comas vincti cenant et carmina dictant. κιο
Ipse eg0, qui nullos me adfirmo scribere versuS,
invenior Parthis mendacior, et prius orto
sole vigil calamum et chartas et scrinia posc0.
Navem agere ignarus navis timet ; habrotonum aegro
non audet nisi qui didicit dare; quod medicorum est 115
promittunt medici ; tractant fabrilia fabri :
scribimus indocti doctique poemata passim.

Hic error tamen et levis haec insania quantas
virtutes habeat, sic collige. Vatis avarus
non temere est animus, versus amat, hoc studet unum ; 120
detrimenta, fugas servorum, incendia ridet3

and a politician. Cf. Cic. de Am.
1. 1.

107. minui, etc.: cf. the elder

Horace's instructions to his son,
, Sat. 1. 4. ¹05·

108. mutavit, etc.: iae. but now
we have changed all that, and have
suddenly become frivolous like the
GreekS, and the natural conse uence
is that everybody writes„ w ether
well or ill. This is apparently in-
serted to account for the poor qual·
ity os much that is written. The
mistake made by the critics is in
classing all alike, —a side glauce at
the main theme again. — calet, is

109. severi: τῖε. who should be
devoted to more serious putsuits.

110. fronde, etc.: τῖε. as devotees
of the Muses. — dictant, improvise,
dictating them on the spot to a slave
to take down. · .

the objects of his satire.

112. Parthiez proverbial 3 ciper-

de Albion, and the British idea of
rench disingenuousness.

113. vigil: cf. vigilare, v. 104.
-scrinia, books,· the article itself is
not distinguishable from the capsa
or book-holder; it evidently con-
tained rollS‚ intended here perhaps
to be translated or imitated, as that
was the way in which the poetry he
is speaking os was written.

114. navem, etc.: i.e. all other
professions are recognized as re-
3:13‘¹2.÷..{‘i¹1³,2;³‘{ffi¹131. but ffiss‘l‘?
num: a bitter herb, used as a rem-
edy for several diseaseS. Cf. Pliny,
H. N. XXI. 92 (160). It is doubt-
less chosen here as a common and
innocuous remedy.

118. hic error, etc. ε the poet
jocosely enumerates the advantages
that after all flow from this craze.

119. sic collige: cf. Sat. 11. 1.
51.—vatis avarus, etc.= ἐκ. this
passion keeps the poet from covet-
ousness.

121. detrimenta, ete: tle, in
