HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 11.

Offenduntur enim, quibus est equus et pater et τες,

’ nec si quid fricti ciceris probat et nucis emptor,

aequis accipiunt animis donantve corona. 250
Syllaba longa brevi subiecta vocatur iambuS,

pes citus; unde etiam trimetris accrescere iussit

nomen iambeiS‚ cum senos redderet ictus,

primus ad extremum similis sibi: non ita pridem,

tardior ut paullo graviorque veniret ad aureS, 255 .

spondeos stabilis in iura paterna recepit

commodus et patiens, non ut de sede secunda

cederet aut quarta socialiter.

Hic et in Acci

nobilibus trimetris apparet raruS, et Enni

bly to the person addressed, like
billi ngsgate) .

248. equus: the allusion is to
the equus publicus originally as·
signed to the equites.

249. ciceris, nucis: the food of
the poorer classes3 cf. Sat. 11. 3.
182. These viands were sold in
booths around the theatre3 hence
emptor.

2 50. aequis animis, with favor,
or approval.— corona: the idea is
derived from Greek contests‚ and is
here only figuratively used.

251. syllaba, etc.: apparently an
unnecessary explanation. But as
Horace is going to discuss the strict
mette of the Greeks as opposed
to the license of the early Roman
dramatists, it is not so unnatural
for him to begin with a definition,
especially as it is precisely the syl·
laba brevis that makes the differ-
enee.

252. pes citus: the same general
idea is expressed in, Sed sunt insig-
nes percussiones eorum numerorum
(Iambic and Trochaic) et minuti
pedes, Cic. de Orat. 111. 47, 182. —
unde: i.e. from the rapidity of the
feet, and frequent occurrence of the

ictus (cf. percussionem above). —

trimetris: cf. nomen mihi Mer·
curiost. — accrescere: become at·
tached. — iussit: i.e. pes citus.

254. iambeis: as a noun, after
accrescere. - senos: i.e. six feet
with only three principal ictus, like
music in ξ time as opposed to ξ.

2 54. primus, etc. ε i.e. pure iambs,
as in the alternate lines of Epode
XVI. — non ita pridem, etc.: Hor-
ace conceives the pure iambic as
the original form of the verse, made
more sonorous by the occasional
spondee (so called) after the time
of Archilocbu53 cf. v. 80.

256. stabilis, stately, steady·
gomg.

257. non ut, but not so as to.

258. socialiter: only here, and
of uncertain meaning ; (probably),
as full allies, in equal partnership,
inasmuch as spondees are not socii
aequo iure, but are excluded from
certain places.— hic: the iambus.
—Acciz cf. Accius isdem aedilibus
(13.0. 140) ait se et Pacuvium docu-
isse sabulam cum ille octoginta, ipse
triginta annos natus esset, Cic.
Brut. LXIV. 229. Horace probably
refers to him as the most learned of
the early dramatistS.

259. Enni, etc.: i.e. his power·
