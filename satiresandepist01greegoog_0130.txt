Quare per divos oratus uterque PenatiS,

tu cave ne minuaS, tu ne maius facias id '

quod satis esse putat pater et Qascoercet.

Praeterea ne vos titillet gloria, iure

iurando obstringam ambo: uter aedilis fueritve 180
vestrum praetor, is intestabilis et sacer esto,

In cicere atque faba bona tu perdasque lupinis,

latus ut in Circo spatiere et aeneus ut steS,

nudus agriS, nudus nummiS, insane, paternis?

Scilicet ut plausuS, q'uos fert Agrippa, feras tu, 185
astuta ingenuum volpes imitata leonem ἒ ’ --

gance, and tries to justify himself.
