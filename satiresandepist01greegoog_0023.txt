city would not have to get up so
early. — cetera de genere hoc,
the other cases ofthis kind. An old
formula, borrowed by the poet from

Β Lucretius.

13. adeo, so, to the degree indi·
cated by the fact stated (not as a
result, but directly) in valent. The
same idea might be expressed as a
result by ut valeant, but it would
be more formal. This reference of
demonstrative words to something
not expressed but implied in the
context is very common in Latin,
and, indeed, in all languages, for
that matter.

14. delassare, i.e. if he should
undertake to enumerate them.—
valent‚ are enough to. -— Fabium:
an old scholiast says the reference
is to Q. Fabius Maximus of Narbo,
who wrote on the Stoic philosophy
in the wordy style of that sect.
And, as this also agrees with the
allusions in Sat. Ι. 2. 134, the two
may well be the same person.

15. quo rem deducam, the
point I am coming to (lit. whither
J am bringing the matter), i.e. the
insincerity of men in these wishes
to change their lot. This insincer-
ity he shows dramatically by intro·
ducing an imaginary scene of a god
appear-ing and offering to grant

their wishes. In such a case they
would refuse. The reason why,
which is their love of money, he
begins to state in v. 28, which
brings him to his main theme.

15. en, look you.—ego: the ex·
pression of ego by its emphasis
gives a force something like “You
want to have your lots changed3
well, then, I 'll do it for you.’'

17. hinc, to that side ,· lit. from
this side, like a parte dextra.—
mutatis, changing. The perf. part.
is often best rendered by our pres·
ent, which the Latin lacks.

18. partibus, roles, the regular
theatrical word. — heia, halloo, as
if he said, “ What does this mean?
I thought you wanted to change.''

as they are bidden in discedite.—
nolint, they wouldn't care to, would
reficse, the apodosis to dicat, v. 15.
— licet, they might. One expects
the subjunctive, but verbs of this
kind take the indicative, in cases
where there is a protasis expressed
orzlffpggctltcas inflet: to show the
extreme inconsistency of the behav-
ior of these personS, the poet gives
a comic picture of Jove’s wratb,
probably borrowed from the stage.
