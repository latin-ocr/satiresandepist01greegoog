Ad Regem redeo,

Postquam nihil inter utrumque

quo forteS, quibus adversum bellum incidit; inter
Hectora Priamiden animosum atque inter Achillem

ira fuit capitalis, ut ultima divideret morS,

does not appear. The heroes refuse
to fight because of ancient friend-

put this construction on the actS,
or it may have been already done
through the belittling spirit of latet
times.

declining to fight, the coward goes
so far as to give something to buy
off his adversary.
