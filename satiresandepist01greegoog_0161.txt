amount of wine and water. Cf. 11.
2. 12 .

69.3 insanie, absurd, crazy, as
being irrational, merely freaks of
fashion. — capit: i.e. is able to
stand. — acria, strong.

70. laetius, etc„ delzglzts rather
to, eto—ergo: i.e. in accordance
with the frugal character of the
meal. Cf. II. 2. 4 seq.

71. alienis: which would indi-
cate envy or rivalry in display,
whereas their conversation is di-
rected to their own ethical improve-
ment.

72. Lepos (a pantomime dancer):
as a sample of trivial themes.

⁴73. utrumne: cf. ΙΙ. 3. 295 with
n e.

74. divitiis, etc.: one of the
favorite ethical questions of the
ancients was whether men could
be perfectly happy (beatissimi)
through virtue alone, the Stoic
school holding that it was possible,
⁴against the PeripateticS. Cf. Cic.
T usc. Disp. V. passim.

75. usus rectumne, advantage
(cf. Ι. 1. 73), or virtue (honestum,
τὸ πρέπον, cf. I. 1. 107), the former
being the Epicurean, and the latter

the Stoic viem-trahat: iae. the
origin of friendship.

76. boni, the good,· the technical
name for that which being in itself
desirable may be used as the crite·
rion of human action, answering in
ancient philosophy to “ the chief
end of man.'’—summum eius:
the summum bonum, called also

finis bonorum, and extremum ἢ

bonum, the ultimate foundation of
all ethical systems. Cf. Cicero de
Finibus, passim, which is a treatise
on that subject.

77. Cervius: doubtless a neigh-
bor (cf. mei, v. 65) dining with the
poet.—-haec inter, in the talk.—
garrit, tells in lively strain. —
anilis fabeIIaS, nursery tales, like
“ old wives' fables,'' but without the·
contempt implied in that phrase.

78. ex re, in point, arising ftom
the subject, and illustrating it.—
Arelli: a rich neighbor‚ —so that
after all, human nature was too much
for them, and they did talk “de
villis domibusve alienis.''

79. sollicitas», care-kaunted. —-
ignarus, fholishly, not knowing the
true nature of happiness. ——olim‚
once upon a time.
