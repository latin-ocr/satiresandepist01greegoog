hic atque ille ? '

[Lm. I.

Avidos vicinum funus ut aegros

exanimat, mortisque metu sibi parcere cogit,
sic teneros animos aliena opprobria saepe

absterrent vitiis,

Ex hoe ego sanus ab illis

perniciem quaecumque ferunt mediocribus et quis 130
ignoscas vitiis teneor 3 fortassis et istinc
largiter'abstulerit longa aetaS, liber amicuS,

consilium proprium : neque enim, cum lectulus aut me

porticus excepit, desum mihi.
‘ Hoc faciens vivam meliuS.’

‘ Rectius hoc est.'
‘ Sic dulcis amicis 135

occurram! ⁴ Hoc quidam non belle 3 numquid ego iili

imprudens olim faciam simile ? ’

134. desum, do I neglect myself.
— rectius, tlze truer course.

136. hoc quidam, etc.= Horace

s a no , e c.

138. agito, I turn over. — da·
tur, is allowed me.

139. inlude, I playfully jot

of those he has not been able to
cure himself of.

141. multa, etc.: a droll form
