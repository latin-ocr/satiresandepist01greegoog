HORATI EPISTVLAE.

271

proficiente nihil curarier: audieraS, cui

rem di donarent, illi decedere pravam

stultitiam, et curn sis nihilo sapientior, ex quo

plenior eS, tamen uteris monitoribus isdem?

At si divitiae prudentem reddere possent, 155
si cupidum timidumque minus te, nempe rubereS,
viveret in terris te si quis avarior uno,

Si proprium est quod quis libra mercatus et aere est,
quaedam, si credis consultiS, mancipat usus ;

qui te pascit ager tuus est, et vilicus Orbi,

160

cum segetes occat tibi mox frumenta daturas,
te dominum sentit ; das nummos, accipis uvam,
puIIOS, ova, cadum temeti: nempe modo isto
paullatim mercaris agrum, fortasse trecentis

· seek wealth as a cure for folly when yers. — mancipat: i.e. passes the

you have found by experience that
it is useless?

151. audieras, etc.= the appli-
cation of the parallel.

155. at si, etc.: an indirect proof
that riches do not give wisdom.

158. si proprium, etc.: an ex-
amination into the nature of prop-
erty, in which Horace shows that in
both of the two ways in which prop-
erty is acquired all the wealth which
serves your purposes is really yours.
—libra et aere: the conventional
form of conveyance at Rome (per
aes et libram). This process, a relic
of the earlier payment of money
by weight, required five Roman citi-
zens as witnesses and a weigher
(libripens), before whom the par-
ties appeared. With a set form
of words the buyer claimed the

3333&ssssss ξαὲἒέἒ-’ἒ ἴῖαὲἰῖἓὶ
which he handed over to the seller.
This worked a mancipatio, hence
mancipat.

159. consultis, the learned Q

property, or makes a title.

160. pascit: i.e. for this consti·
tutes the usus in the sense in which
Horace takes that word, though the
preceding verse is only true in the
other, the technical, sense, i.e. of ad-
verse possession, prescription (usu
capio). Cf. Cic. ad Fam. VII. 30.
—ususz here used in the sense of
‘usucapio Cf. the two preceding
notes. —vilieus Orbi, etc.: here
the poet proceeds to show that the
enjoyer practically owns the prop-
erty even by the first method, sor
he buys it by degrees.—0rbi: an
unknown person, probably a famous
nabob of the time, or a rich neigh-
bor of the poen—vilicus: cf. Ι.
14. 1.

161. segetes, field, properly the
growing crop.—occat: put for all
the operations of husbandry. — tibi ε
because you will buy it.

162. te dominum sentit, recog-
nines, etc.; in so far as he knows
that he works for your advantage.

164. fortasse trecentis, etc:
