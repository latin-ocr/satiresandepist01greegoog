people preferred a Laevinus to an
obscure worthy man (which, as he
has just said, they do not), it would
be justified in doing so; and the
man of low birth would have no
reason to complain‚ 'because he has

ought to hold virtue higher and
birth lower than they, for even if
they did prefer the high-born to the
worthy in this particular case (of
political preferment), they would be
justified; hence, as they do not,
their example is all the more forci-
ble for us,’' It must be remembered
that after all Horace is dealing with
social relations, which fact he always
keeps in mind, underlying the whole.
—mallet: a condition without si,
suppose they did prefer.

20. Decio: ⁴P. DeciuS, a plebe-
ian consul who devoted himself to
death for the success of the Roman
arms in the Latin War, B.C. 3403

and his son, of the same name, imi· ι

tated his father's example in B.C.
295.—novo: a person whose an-
cestors had held no curule office
was a novus hom0.— moveret:'
turn out of the senate, as Appius
Claudius Pulcher in his censorship,
50 B.c., did all‘sons of freedmen. —
essem: the general idea is repre·
sented by Horace’s own case, though
he had never been in the senate.
As he was, however, the son of a
freedman, his case would be like
the one referred to if he had, and
the mention of a special person
makes the whole more vivid.

22. vel merito= sc. moveret,
though both cases are really meant.
-— in propria pelle, τὶς. his proper
Skin.'’

23. ged: but though the people
would be right in the case supposed,
and such men have no claims, yet
the ambition of the humble will not
be quenched as it ought to be by
that fact. —trahit, i.e. leads captive,
the figure being drawn from the tri-
umph, which the captives accom-
panied in chainS, just before the
conqueror's chariot, possibly origi-
nally chained to it. - gloria, Ambi-
tion.

24. generosis, the nobly born .·
{2305251252‘25335523225 22²5}-
— Tilli: a Tillius said to have been
removed from the senate, wh0, as.
was customary in such cases„ began
anew to seek the senatorial rank.
He was doubtless a freedman.

25. clavum: the single broad
stripe of red down the front of the
tunic which was the sign of magis·
terial and senatorial dignity. —
tribuno: apparently tribunus mili-
tum, since the tribune of the people⁴
appears not to have worn any in-
signia as such, though the office-
would entitle him to be enrolled in
the senate, and so afterwards to re-
ceive the insignia mentioned. Some
of the tribunes of the soldiers wore-
the laticlave‚ and were chosen into2
the senate, a custom introduced by

Augustus.
