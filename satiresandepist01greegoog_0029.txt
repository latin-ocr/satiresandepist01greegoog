HORATI SERMONES.

quos tibi dat, retinere velis servareque amicoS,

infelix operam perdaS‚ ut si quis asellum
in campo doceat parentem currere freniS.

Denique sit finis quaerendi, cumque habeas pluS,
pauperiem metuas minuS‚ et finire laborem
incipiaS, parto quod avebaS, ne fa‘cias quod
meidius quidam. Non longa est fabula: dives, 95
ut metiretur numm05‚ ita sordidus, ut se
non umquam servo melius vestiret, ad usque
supremum tempuS‚ ne se penuria victus

your taking any trouble. The read-
ing an si could mean, ‘⁶ Do you
think it would be useless labor to
attempt to win friends? '’ The first
seems better. Notice Horace does
not say get, but keep.

92. cum, now that.

93. metuas, begin to sear. —
finire, set a limit. Nonce that
Horace does not advise him to stop
suddenly, but begin, as it were, to
think of an end. .

94. parto: in early prose the ante-
cedent of quod would be expressed
in agreement with partu, but con·

omission, which is common later.

T yndareus’ line. Tire allusion is to
Clytemnestra, who killed her lord
in the same manner, as if it were
“the most undaunted of husband-
slayerS.” It is of course implied
that the woman was a concubine,
so that the case is an illustration of
the idea in non uxor, etc„ and the
following.

101. quid mi suadeS, εἴας the-
miser thinks that the poet in con-
demning avarice approves extrava-
gance, and asks if he wants him to
be a Maenius (a spendthrift). A
reading Naevius refers to a per-
son said to have been a miser.
This gives a passable sense, though
not approved by the commentators;
as if he said, “ What do you advise
me, then, to be a miser, or do you
want me to be a spendthrist? '² as if
these were the only alternatives, and
there could be no doubt which was

gives two examples of spendthrifts.
