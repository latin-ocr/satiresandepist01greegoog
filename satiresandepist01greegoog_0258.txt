HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm Ι.

Non erit emisso reditus tibi.

Fuge quo descendere gestis. 5

aut fugies Vticam aut vinctus mitteris Ilerdam.

Ridebit monitor non exauditus, ut ille,

qui male parentem in rupes protrusit asellum 15
iratus ε quis enim invitum servare laboret ?

Hoc quoque te manet, ut pueros elementa docentem
