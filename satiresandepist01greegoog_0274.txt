HORATI EP18TVLAE.

[Lm. 11.

Saepe etiam audacem fugat hoc terretque poetam,

quod numero plureS, virtute et honore minoreS,

indocti stolidique et depugnare parati,

si discordet eques media inter carmina poscunt 185
aut ursum aut pugiles his nam plebecula gaudet.
Verum equitis quoque iam migravit ab aure voluptas
omnis ad incertos oculos et gaudia vana.

Quattuor aut plures aulaea premuntur in horaS,

dum fugiunt equitum turmae peditumque catervae ; 190
mox trahitur manibus regum fortuna retortiS‚

esseda festinant, pilenta, petorrita, naveS,

that would be my case; Ι bid good
by to the comic stage if my happi-
ness depends on the uncertain favor
of the spectator. .

182. saepe etiarn, etc.: another
reason why men do not write for
the stage. — audacem, tlte balden,-
i.e. one who ventures to try it once,
as it were, and meets with this dis·
couragement.

183. plures: ale. the plebecula
of v. 186.

184. depugnare, etc.: i.e. they
are unwilling to yield to the better
taste of the higher class (eques),
but are ready· to fight it out and
have their way by main force.

185. carmina: i-e. the verses of
the glay.

1 6. ursum: τῖε. abeat-baiting.

187. verum, equitis„ etc.: i.e.
but the fact is, that the taste of the
higher classeS, t00, has deteriorated‚
and even they take more pleasure
in spectacular plays with “ live
horses'’ and “real water ’' than in
the true dramatic art.

188. incertos, restless,· i.e. the
various spectacle draws their eyes
now this way and now that, while
they do not look upon any one
thing long enough to take any
thought os the meaning of the whole

(hence vana).—vana, idle, mere
pleasures* of sense which have no
thought or even emotion behind
them.

189. quattuor, etc.: i.e. a real
battle is presented (cf. the modern
realistic drama), lasting four or five
houm. — premuntur: it must be
remembered that the ancient curtain
rolled down, instead of up, as with
us,

191. mox trahitur, etc.: τῖε. after
the battle, the triumph is repre-
sented. Cf. Sat. I. 6. 23, and note.
—regurn fortuna: a common poet-
ical figure by which the fortunes of
the kings are put for the kings them·
selves, Translate, kings of fallen

fortune. The case of Perseus is

perhaps the most pathetic.

192. esseda: the war chariot os
the Gauls. —— pilentaz a covered
two-wheeled carriage, the regular
conveyance of matronS, and also
of vestal virgins and priestesses; as
these latter accompanied the trium·
phal procession, the reference here
may be to them. — petorrita: a
covered carriage differing from the

pilentum in having four wheels

(whence its name).- lt hardly apl·
pears who rode m 1t m a triump
·— naves: all sorts of representa-
