HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 11.

Conversis studiis aetas animusque virilis

quaerit opes et amicitias, inservit honori,
commisisse cavet quod mox mutare laboret.
Multa senem circumveniunt incommoda, vel quod

quaerit et inventis miser abstinet ac timet uti,

170

vel quod res omnis timide gelideque ministrat,

dilator, spe longuS, inerS, avidusque futuri,

difficilis, querulus, laudator temporis acti

se puer0, castigator censorque minorum.

Multa ferunt anni venientes commoda secum ; 175

multa recedentes adimunt.

Ne forte seniles

‘mandentur iuveni partes pueroque virileS,
semper in adiunctis aevoque morabimur aptis.
Aut agitur res in scaeniS, aut acta refertur.

Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem

the spectator is said to communicate
it to himself, be his own witness.
