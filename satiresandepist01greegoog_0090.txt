HORATI SERMONES.

[LIB. Ι.

aut citius possit versus? quis membra movere
mollius? invideat quod et Hermogenes ego cant0.’ 25
Interpellandi locus hic erat: ‘ Est tibi mater,
cognati, quis te salvo est opus ? ’— ‘ Haud mihi quisquam ;
omnis composui.' — “Felices! Nunc ego resto,
Confice; namque instat fatum mihi triste, Sabella
quod puero cecinit divina mota anus urna: 30
“ Hunc neque dira venena, nec hosticus auferet ensis,
nec laterum dolor aut tussis, nec tarda podagra ,-
garrulus hunc quando consumet cumque‚· loquaci&
si sapiat, vitet, simul atque adoleverit aetas.” '
Ventum erat ad Vestae, quarta iam parte diei -35
praeterita, et casu tunc respondere vadato
debebat; quod ni fecisset, perdere litem.

24. membra movere, clance.

25. mollius, more gracesully.
Dancing was a rather disreputable
accomplishrnent among the Romans
at this time (cf. Cic. pro Mur. VI.
13). —quodz the acc. of the thing
after invideat. Its antecedent id or
tale would be the object of cante.

26. hic locus erat, etc.: appar-
ently the opportunity was his men-
tion of his accomplishmentS, to
which Horace replies, as if feeling
that so accomplished a man was too
valuable to expose to danger; “ have
you any friends dependent on you ἰ’ ”
lmplying that there is danger in
going to see the sick person. The
answer destroys this hope of getting
rid of him, and Horace's reply as
far as v. 35 must be supposed to
be made aside in his own thought.
Itis obvious that if Horace's good
nature would allow him to speak in
that tone to the fellow, he would
have got rid of him long before.

29. confice: jocosely said, as if
he had bored all his friends to
death, and now was going to crown
the whole by killing off Horace.

Of course the allusion to his destiny
is an invention.-- Sabella: the
Sabines and the mountain people
generally were famous for super-
stitions and divination‚ acting, it
would seem, as a sort of gipsies.

30. divina, prophetie. —- urna, in
which the lots (sortes) were cast
(cf. Od. ΙΙ. 3. 26), and shaken
(mota), whereupon one came to
the sursace, which was drawn out.

32. tussis: i.e. consumption.—
tarda, crzsppling: a transferred epi·
theu it was the patient that was
s ow.

33. quando . . . cumque, at some
time or other, whenever it is·

south end of the Forum, near which
was the temple of Vesta and the
courts of justice—quarta: i.e. it
was past nine.

36. vadato, a plainti in a
lawsuit, who had made lgm give
bail to appear on this day. ·
