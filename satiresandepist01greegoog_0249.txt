surge et inhumanae senium depone Camenae,

cenes ut pariter pulmenta laboribus empta:

Romanis sollemne viris opus, utile famae

vitaeque et membriS, praesertim cum valeas et . 50
vel cursu superare canem vel viribus aprum

possis.
non est qui tractet.

Adde virilia quod speciosius arma
Scis quo clamore coronae

proelia sustineas campestria3 denique saevam

militiam puer et Cantabrica bella tulisti 55
sub duce, qui templis Parthorum signa refigit

nunc et si quid abest Italis adiudicat armis,

Ac ne te retrahas et inexcusabilis absiS,

quamvis nil extra numerum fecisse modumque

47. inhumanae, unsocial, as ex-
acting, and intolerant of distractionS.
— senium, impatience, i.e. at being
interrupted, which is characteristic
of literary pursuits.

49. sollemne, habitual, and so
all the more appropriate for a
Roman. — opus z in apposition with
the whole previous exhortation.
Such words expressing the result of
the action of a verb are regularly
in the accusative3 cf. ,the cognate
accusative. cf. Tac. Ann. Ι. 74.

50. valeas, etc.: a further reason
for engaging in hunting, drawn from
Lollius' personal characteristica

51. cursu, speed. — viribus, en-
durance.

52. adde, etc.: i.e. furthermore
it is an exercise in which Lollius
appears to advantage.

53. coronae, the crowd, of spec-
tators witnessing the exercises on
the Campus Martius. Cf. campe,

54.⁵ proelia: tle. javelin throwing,
and perhaps soil practice; possibly
mimic cavalry battles: cf. the Game
of Troy, Virg. Aen. V. 545 seq.

55. Cantabrica bena: in Bc.

25 Augustus undertook an expedi-
tion into Spain to subdue the Can-
tabri and Astures (cf. Od. III. 14 and
IV. 14. 41). Lollius must have
served in this expedition.

56. templis, etc.: alluding to
the army sent by Augustus against
the Parthians so often referred to.
Cf. Od. IV. 15. 6 and 111. 5. 4; Ep.
1. 12. 27.— signa refigit: as the
standards captured from Crassus and
Antonius had been presumably dedi-
cated in Roman fashion on the col-
umns of the Parthian temples, so
they are now being unhung to be
restored to the Romans, The epis-
tle must therefore have been written
in Bc, 20.

57. si quid abest, etc.: i.e. he
ξοῖῗῗριῗῗέἑίἑῖἒίῃῗὲἒὲιῖἓἕὲἒὲἱὲ

the right of the Romans to universal
epiplilre aiud gives them possession
o eir omam. .

58. ne te retrahas, etc.: not the
purpose of what is said, but the
