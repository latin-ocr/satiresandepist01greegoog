HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. Ι.

Qui recte vivendi prorogat horam,

rusticus exspectat dum defluat amnis; at ille

labitur et labetur in omne volubilis aevum.

Quaeritur argentum puerisque beata creandis

uxor et incultae pacantur vomere silvae. 45
Quod satis est cui contingit, nihil amplius optet.

Non domus et fundus non aeris acervus et auri

aegroto domini deduxit'corpore febriS,

non animo curas.

Valeat possessor oportet,

si comportatis rebus bene cogitat uti. 50
Qui cupit aut metuit, iuvat illum sic domus et reS, ἡ

ut lippum pictae tabulae, fomenta podagram,

auriculas citharae collecta sorde dolentes,

Sincerum est nisi vas, quodcumque infundis acescit.

withstand temptation, not in refer-
ence to any risk, but merely to the
pain of sels-denial.

42. rusticus, is like the country-
men who (cf. 1. 1. 2, note), referring
to some well-known story.

44. quaeritur, etc.: we keep on
secking to get more of the good
things of life without paying atten-
tion to our moral state, whereas
true philosophy would teach us that
moral health is the first thing which
would make all our desired good
things unnecessary and without
which we cannot enjoy them at all.
— argentum: put for wealth gen·
erally. —pueris creandis: i.e. to
found a family to preserve our estates
and our memory after death, an
obJect of ambition not sanctioned
by philosophy. ——beata, rich, to in-
crease our wealth by her dowry‚ and
by uniting families to establish an
illustrious house.

45. pacantur, etc.: i.e. we en·
large our lauded estates. All these
things are the objects of worldly
ambition which become nought in
the eyes of the contented (quod
satis est, etc.) sage.

47. non domus, etc.: a familiar
idea with Horace, cf. Od. 111. ι.
41 seqq. The real force, however, is
in the non animo curas, “they
will not do the one any more than
the other.'' Cf. neque . . . nec, od.
III. .27.

48} deduxit: the so-called gno·
mic aoristic perfect, “they never
did, and so presumably they never
will.’'

49. valeat: in reference to both
the bodily and the mental ills just
spoken of, but of course particularly
to the latter. The same comparison,
almost confusion, of bodily and
moral unsoundnaes is continued in
the next verseS.

l 50. cogitat, expects, like the dia-
lectic “ calculates.'’

51. cupit aut metuit: referring
to moral diseases, πάθη, passions.

52. fomenta: hot water appli-

Ι cations used by the ancients for
fpleasurable indulgence, but in this
⁶. case the deep-seated disease pre·
vents any enjoyment.

“ 54. sincerum, etc.: i.e.pleasure
offered to a soul disturbed by pas-
‚sion is spoiled.
