HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 11.

et sine pondere erunt et honore indigna ferentur,
verba movere loco, quamvis invita recedant
et versentur adhuc intra penetralia Vestae„

Obscurata diu populo bonus eruet atque

115

proferet in lucem speciosa vocabula rerum

quae priscis memorata Catonibus atque Cethegis
nunc sitis informis premit et deserta vetustas;
adsciscet nova, quae genitor produxerit usus,

Vehemens et liquidus puroque simillimus amni

120

fundet opes Latiumque beabit divite lingua; ’
luxuriantia compescet, nimis aspera sano

112. honore: cf. splendoris and
note.

113. movere loco, turn out (ale.
of his poetical vocabulary), a techni-
cal expression of the act of the Cen-
sor in degrading an unworthy per-
son. — invita, etc.: i.e. though they
have a strong hold on the language.

1 14. et versentur, etc.= i.e. and
still linger at Rome in the common
use of the people, But why Vestae?
Servius (to Ae. vii. 153) says: ad
A tri um Vestae conveniebat (senatus).
If this statement can be relied on,
no doubt Horace, keeping up the
figure, makes the words linger, like
an expelled Senator about his meet-
ing place. Other views have been
suggested. One possible view refers
to the domestic expressions of the

fireside. Every one knows how
many colloquial expressions are re·

tained in the family circle. But
Vesta is not certainly shown in

Latin to represent the household ,

hearth. The best way seems to be
to take the phrase as referring to
the ᾗ heart ² of the Roman people,
ue. ln common use.

115. obscurata, etc.: i.e. the
poet in his search for a fresh and
vigorous diction will restore to use
good old words that were pictur-
esque but have slipped out of use.

The figure of the Censor is half pre·
served here also. —populoz i.e. in
common use. — bonus: as opposed
to his severity towards the unwor-
thy. -- eruet, will unearth.

116. speciosa: ale. vivid and
picturesque.

117. quae priscis, etc.: cf. 11.
3. o.

318. situs, neglect, originally of
things left to lie and gather rust
from want of care and use (hence
informis). — informis, uncomely,
as producing that effect.——premit,
obscures, keeps out of use. -— de-
serta, fhrsaken, i.e. their age has
caused the words to be abandoned.

119. genitor, creative,· cf. 11. 3.

1.
⁷ 120. vehemens (two syllables),
strong. The whole idea is taken
from a river.
“ Though deep yet clear . . .

Strong without tage ; without overflow·
ing, fulv·

—Sir John Denham.
The style is to be rich and strong,
but still clear.
121. opes, a stream qfwealth.
122. luxuriantia: i.e. excess of
ornament. — compescet, prune, as
a too luxuriant growth of vegeta·

used—aspera, roughness, as of a
