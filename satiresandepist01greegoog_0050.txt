30 HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. I.

ne scutica dignum horribili sectere flagello

Nam, ut ferula caedas meritum maiora subire

verbera, non vereor, cum dicas esse pares res
furta latrociniis, et magnis parva mineris
falce recisurum simili te, si tibi regnum

permittant homines.

Si dives qui sapiens est,

et sutor bonus et solus formosus et est rex, 125
cur optas quod habes? ⁴ Non nosti quid pater,' inquit,

119. scutica, the whsz, an in·
strument of whipping more severe
than the rod (ferula), and less so
than the scourge (flagellum),
which last had pieces of metal
-attached to its lasheS.

120. ut caedas: the regular
grammar re uires ne (as the clause
must be rmafive), and no ex·
planation os the irregularity is satis·
factory. Perhaps Horace allows
himself a popular construction, i.e. a
mistake in grammar. The meaning
of course is, “I say the rule is
needed to prevent too great severity,
for there is no sear that the Stoic
principle will lead to too great in·
dulgence.'' A similar use of ut
occurs in Livy, 28. 22, where, as
here, the ut clause precedes.

122. furta, without violence.—
latrociniis, accompanied by force.
The same distinction exists between
thesi and robbers—magum, with
simili (cf. “ hair like the Graces '').

123. falce, etc.: i.e. punishment,
regarded as a pruning away of
the vices of the State.— tibi: i.e.
the Stoic, against whom the whole
argument is aimed, and against
whose follies and unfitness for so·
cial life the remainder of the satire
is directed. The transition is af-
forded by the words which Horace
quotes, as it were from the Stoic:
“1 would prune away, ete„ if rnen
would make me king,’' implying a

wish to be so (hence optas, v. 126).
Horace then replieS, “According
to your doctrine, you are a king
already.'’ To which the Stoic re-
plies, “The Stoic doctrine is not
that a sapiens is an actual king, but
only a king in posse.'' Thus the
Stoic shows the inapplicability of
his own doctrines to actual life,
which is the effect Horace wishes
to produce, in order to nullify the
excuse which the Stoic views give
for censoriousness and harshness.

124. si dives, etc.= the Stoic
paradox is, ὅτι μόνος ὁ σοφὸς πλού-
σιος, solum sapientem esse divitem.
See Cic. Paradox, VI.

125. sutor: alluding to the per·
fection of the sapiens in all direc-
tions, but containing in itsels a re-
ductio ad absurdum. — formosus:
of course the perfect man must
possess perfect physical beauty
among his other perfectioris· —
rex: according to the Stoic doc-
trine, the sapiens'is king, and all
othegs are slaves. (Cf. Ep. Ι. 1.
106.

126. pater, the venerable.

127. Chrysippus: the second
great expounder of the Stoic viem,
so famous that it was said, εἰ μὴ
γὰρ ᾖν Χρύσιππος, οὐκ ἂν {virod- —
ἓέἕίὲῖῗὲὲ {stilla {iratast}
the existence in perfectiori of all
qualities in the sapiens by a ridicu·
