HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. I.

VII.
Quinque dies tibi pollicitus me rure futurum

Sextilem toturn mendax desideror.

Atqui

si me vivere vis sanum recteque valentem,
quam mihi das aegr0, dabis aegrotare timenti,
MaecenaS, veniam, dum ficus prima calorque 5 ‘
dissignatorem decorat lictoribus atris;

dum pueris omnis pater et matercula pallet,
officiosaque sedulitas et opella forensis
adducit febris et testamenta resignat.

, Ems‘rLE 7. Though Horace was
'a man of humble extraction and
position, brought by his genius and
education into companionship with
the great, yet he seems to have been
entirely free from servility of nature,
and accordingly to have preserved
his independence even in the diffi-
xcult relation of client and patron.
For his sels-respect we may com-
pare Sat. I. 6, and for his views of
the relation of clientship, Ep. Ῑ. 18.
This epistle was evidently written
to Maecenas to justify himself for
preferring considerations of -health
to the claims of his patron. He
had apparently retired from the
city to the country (perhaps to
Tibur. Cf. vv. 45 and 10) for a few
days, and had continued away for
a month, and now had it in mind
to remain away the whole winter.
While excusing himself on the plea
of ill health, he also asserts (v.
ἐξ sle‘thhisflfl-'b'ertd gf action within

e imiso rien s ip.

1. quinque: often loosely used
of a short indefinite time.—rure:
probably at Tibur.

2. Sextilem: the mouth of Au-
gust was not so named until 8 B.c.
—— desideret, I allow mysels to be
missed. — atqui, and yet (though 1
fail to keep my promise).

3. sanum recteque valentem:
without essentia} difference of mean-
ing, like well ond strong, in good
health and vtjgor.

4. aegrotare: here equivalent to
the regular construction with ne,
though properly used with a differ·
ent meaning.

5. dum ficus, etc.: a poetical
description of the unhealthy season
of autumn.

6. dissignatorem, the under-
taker‚ who managed funereus, much
as in modern times—decorat: of
course the presence of the lictors,
as “assistant marshals,” would in-
dicate a splendid funeral, and so
they are said to be the undertaker’s
adommentS. — atris : clothed in
black, as in modern times.

7. matercula, fond mother, the
diminutive of affection, reversed as
it were.

8. officiosa: i.e. in the perform-
ance of dutieS, especially social
(officia), as the attendance upon
the great and the like. —opella fo·
tensis: in reference to the services
of the patronus, which at this season
would be petty and insignificant.

9. testamenta resignat: natu-
rally, by killing off the testator.

10. quodsi bruma, etc.: i.e. if
the winter becomes too cold there.
