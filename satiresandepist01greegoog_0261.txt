HORATI EPISTVLAE.

239

Romulus et Liber pater et curn Castore Pollux, 5
post ingentia facta deorum in templa recepti,

dum terras hominumque colunt genuS, aspera bella
componunt, agros adsignant, oppida condunt,

ploravere suis non respondere favorem

speratum meritis

Diram qui contudit hydram 10

notaque fatali portenta labore subegit,
comperitinvidiam supremo fine domari.

Vrit enirn fulgore suo qui praegravat artis

infra se positaS, exstinctus amabitur idern.

Praesenti tibi maturos largimur honores 15
iurandasque tuum per numen ponimus araS‚

nil oriturum alias, nil ortum tale fatentes,

Sed tuus hic populus sapiens et iustus in unc,

te nostris ducibuS, te Graiis anteferendO,

cetera nequaquam simili ratione modoque ω

by the necessity os reading the et’s
trivial discourse, if it sho d be
made too long. The -reader will
notice that the excuse, as usual with
Horace, is made far more compli-
mentary than any performance could
be. Cf. Sat. ΙΙ. 1. 12.

5. Romulus, etc.: i.e. all the
great benefactors of the race before
you have sailed of recognition in
their lifetime, and only attained
divine honors after their death.

9. ploravere, had to mourn. —-
favorem, applause.

12. invidiam, etc.: i.e. only by
his death did he finally overcome
jealousy and hatred. - domari :
as if that too were a monster like
the others.

13. urit: i.e. and so excites the
animosity of lesser minds whom
his greatness throws in the shade. —-
artis, etc„ the virtues that lie below
him, i.e. inferior minds.

14. exstinctus, etc. ι τῖε. as a dead

man he censes to be a rival, and is
then appreciated.

15. praesenti, among us, τῖε.
while still alive we give you the
honors for which the others had to
wait till their death. —- maturos,
timely, as not too late for you to
enJoy.

16. iurandas, to witness oaths,
used transitively, as often, perhaps
following Greek usage. With this
construction, however, is combined
the more common one with per.
As to the fact, cf. Claudius natus
est Lugduni eo ipso die (B.C. ιο)
quo primum ara ibi Augusto dedi·
cata est (Suet. Claud, 2); and Tem·

pla, quamvis sciret etiam procon-

sulibus decerni solere, in nulla
tamen provincia nisi communi suo
Romaeque nomine recepit, nam τ’ττ
urbe quidem pertinacissime absti-
nuit hoc honore (Suet. Octav. 52).
18. sed tuus, etc.: in this line
begins the neatly wrought joint. In
