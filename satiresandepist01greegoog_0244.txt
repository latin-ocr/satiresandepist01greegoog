222 HORATI EPISTVLAE. [Lm. Ι.
Coram rege sua de paupertate tacentes .
plus poscente ferent. Distat sumasne pudenter
an rapias, Atqui rerum caput hoc erat, hic sons, 45

‘ Indotata mibi soror est, paupercula mater,

- et fundus nec vendibilis nec pascere firmuS,’

qui dicit, clamat ‘victum date ' ; succinit alter

‘et mihi ’ ε dividuo findetur munere quadra.

Sed tacitus pasci si posset corvus, haberet 50
plus dapis et rixae multo minus invidiaeque.

Brundisium comes aut Surrentum ductus amoenum

qui queritur salebras et acerbum frigus et imbreS,

aut cistam effractam et subducta viatica plorat,

as well as in the active conduct of
affairs, Cf. ν. 33 seq. The two words
belong together, but decus refers
more to the honor, pretium to the
material advantageS, wealth, etc. -
recte: in the adverb lies the signifi-
cant partos the expression, does well
to, ete—experiens vir, the man qf
enterprise, who makes the effort in-
stead of shrinking from it.

43. coram, etc.: in view os the
fact that the worthiness of such a
career depends much upon the man-
ner in which the dependent ad-
vances himself, the 'poet suddenly
without warning proceeds to a cau·
tion as to the manner of conduct-
ing one’s self in regard to gifts.
—rege, his patron, used in refer-
ence doubtless to the ancient rela-
tions of philosophers to kings (as of
Plato with Dionysius). Cf. regibus,
v. 14, which is translated directly
from the Greek.

44. distat: i.e. it makes a differ-
ence in the worthiness of the rela-
tion.

44. sumas: εἴα. what is given
with free will, which a vir bonus
might honorably accept, cf. 1. 1 1. 23.

45. rapias: as a persistent beg-

gar does in effect, and which is un-
worthy the man of honor. —atquiz
in the same loose adversative rela-
tion asin v. 38.—rerum caput et
fons: τῖε. this was the main point,
the end and aim of your friendship
with the great, namely, to be en·
riched by gista—erat: probably
only used instead of est sor metri-
cal reasonS, but justified by the ref-
erence to the original object of the
dependent, cs. fuerat, Juvenal, V. 76.

48. clamat, victum date: i.e.

such conduct is simply begging.- a

succinit, chimes in, i.e. one who
begs thus will find a rival ready to
divide with-him.

49. et mihi, so have I, i.e. a sis-
ter, etc. ——dividuo munere: a
loose ablative of manner. -quadra,
the loa ‚ used generally for a gift to
provi e subsistence. It is so called
from being cut across the top into ,
four sectors of a circle. Α -

5ο. aed tacitus, etc.2 alluding
to the sable of the fox and the crem
, 52. Brundisium ε i.e. on an
errand os business; cf. Sat. Ι. 5.—
eomes : cf. Sat. II. 6. 42. — Surren-
tum amoenum: i.e. on a pleasure
journey‚ cf. I. 7. 76.
