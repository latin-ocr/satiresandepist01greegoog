HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. 11.

aut quia non sentiS, quod clamaS, rectius esse, ⁴ 25
aut quia non firmus rectum defendiS, et haeres
nequiquam caeno cupiens evellere plantam.

Romae rus optas; absentem rusticus urbem

tollis ad astra leviS.

Si nusquam es forte vocatus

ad cenam, laudas securum holuS‚ ac, velut usquam 30
vinctus eas, ita te felicem dicis amasque

quod nusquam tibi sit potandum.

Iusserit ad se

Maecenas serum sub lumina prima venire

convivam ε

‘ Nemon’ oleum fert ocius? Ecquis

audit ? ' cum magno blateras clamore fugisque. 35
Mulvius et scurrae, tibi non referenda precati,

discedunt.

‘ Etenim fateor me,' dixerit ille,

‘duci ventre levem, nasum nidore supinor,

imbecillus, inerS, si quid viS, adde, popin0.

Tu, cum sis quod ego et fortassis nequior, ultro 40
insectere velut melior, verbisque decoris
