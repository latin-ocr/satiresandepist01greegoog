HORATI EPISTVLAE« 177

Thebanos aptare modos studet auspice Musa,

an tragica desaevit et ampullatur in arte?

Quid mihi Celsus agit? Monitus multumque monenduS, 15
privatas ut quaerat opes et tangere vitet

scripta, Palatinus quaecumque recepit Apollo ;

ne si forte suas repetitum venerit olim

grex avium plumas moveat cornicula risum

furtivis nudata coloribus

Ipse quid audes? 20

ingenium, non incultum est ac turpiter hirtum :

seu linguam causis acuis seu civica iura

respondere paras Seu condis amabile carmen,

prima feres hederae victricis praemia.

Quodsi 25

frigida curarum fomenta relinquere posseS‚

quo te caelestis sapientia duceret, ires,

si patriae volumus, si nobis vivere cari.
