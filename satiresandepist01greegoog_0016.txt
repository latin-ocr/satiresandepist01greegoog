vi INTRODUCTION.

by another, caused by the general familiarity with the poet, has
made it next to impossible to establish any familieS, or any pre-
cedence of any, one over others, or even of any dozen over the
rest. So that what we have of Horace is a text very much
altered by the tinkering of scholars according to their knowl-
edge and whimS, but at the same time checked off by reference
to the constant stream of tradition. This process has appar-
ently been going on from the poet’s own time. So that very
little can be done now in the way of improvement of the text,
unless some manuscript should come to light that has lain un-
used for more than a thousand years, For a description of the

manuscripts, the student is referred to Orelli and (less fully)
Keller and Holder.

The Satires and the poems generally seem to have been first
written for private reading and circulation‚ somewhat as single
poems appear nowadays in ephemeral literature and are later
collected into volumes,'and not to have been properly published
until some time after their composition. Exactly at what time
-this was done in the case of the Satires is unknown, but we may
well suppose that the first book was published before B.C. 33,
in which year Horace received from Maecenas the gist of his
Sabine farm, a gist which can hardly be looked upon otherwise
than as a return for the compliment of the dedication to Mae-
cenas in I. 1. There is no clear indication that the two books
of Satires were published separately‚ yet there is a slight differ-
ence of style between the two, and the scene with Trebatius in
ΙΙ. 1. seems to indicate a new undertaking, a conclusion which
is also strengthened by the completeness of the first book and
the evident incompleteness of the second.

The form of composition Horace himself calls Sermones, to
distinguish it from the higher flights of poetry which he attempts
, in his lyrics. But the name Satura must also have been given
to the work at the time (asin ΙΙ. 1. 1), and has always been
the prevailing title.
