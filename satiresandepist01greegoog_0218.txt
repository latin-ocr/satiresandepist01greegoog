Vrbis amatorem Fuscum salvere iubemus

ruris amatores, hac in re scilicet una

multum dissimileS, at cetera paene gemelli:

fraternis animis quicquid negat alter, et alter;
adnuimus pariter vetuli notique columbi. 5
Tu nidum servas ; ego laudo ruris amoeni ’

rivos et musco circumlita saxa nemusque.

Quid quaeris? Vivo et regn0, simul ista reliqui,

quae vos ad caelum effertis rumore secund0,

utque sacerdotis fugitivus liba recuso; 10
pane egeo iam mellitis potiore placentis.

Vivere naturae si convenienter oportet

ponendaeque domo quaerenda est area primum,
novistine locum potiorem rure beato?

Est ubi plus tepeant hiemeS, ubi gratior aura 15

EPISTLE 10. This epistle‚ ad-
dressed to the poet's friend Aristius
Fuscus cf. Od. 1. 225 Sat. 1. 9. 61,

as superior to the city as an abode
of content and moral health.

person, as usual with the pronoun

, of the first person in Latin.

4. negat: the construction is un-
grammatical, throwing in the third
- person as a parenthesis where the
first person plural would be either
untrue or else clumsy.

the person from the speaker to the
one addressed: “Why 'do you ask
more,’' instead of “Why should I
say more.'’ — vivo: i.e. 1 enj0y true
life. — regno: Le. have the freedom
of a king.

manner, the figure is identified with
the object. — liba τ the favorite·
offerings of the common people, of
which in the house of the priest the

slave, now a runaway, has had his
fill. Like him, Horace has enjoyed
the luxuries of the city to his satis·
