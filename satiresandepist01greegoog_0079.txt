sil in the shape of a sea-urchin. It
seems as if it must be a salt-cellar,
the most necessary utensil, and not
elsewhere mentioned, and is so, it
perhaps should not be taken as
earth6en like the patera. (Cf. Od.
11. 1 .-14.

118. cu)m patera guttus: for
libations‚ a platter, and a narrow·
necked pitcher, of common earthen·
ware (Campana), not necessarily
mean, but not silver or gold or
bronze.

120. mane, i.e. early. —- obeun-
dus Marsya: i.e. go to the forum.
(See note on verse 122.) In the
forum stood a statue of Marsyas,
The precise action of the statue to
which Horace refers is uncertain.
Perhaps the agony in his face, or
possibly the fact merely that his back
was turned, is jocosely assumed by

Horace to indicate his dislike of ⁷

. Novius, evidently a usurer who had
his money-changer’s table in the
vicinity.

121. minoris shows that a defi-
nite person is meant, the younger
of two of the same name. Τὶιε
whole reference is unnecessary, but
Horace likes to give a side thrust
wherever he can.

122. ad quartam: the privilege
of lying abed till ten was not pos-
sessed by the great, who must receive
the salutatio at sunrise, and be es·
corted to the forum—vagor: i.e.

he takes a stroll (cf. 9. 1), or stays
at home, and reads or writes in

‚solitude (taciturn) till the'nour for

exercise comes.

123. unguor: the ancients pre-
pared themselves for exercise by
stripping and anointing themselves
with oil.

124. Natta: another side thrust‚ ·
indicating the parsimony of the
unknown person. - immundus z
careless of his person, as a miser.—
lucernis: of course only the poor-
est of oil was used for burning, and
this Natta uses for his body.

125. sol acrior: about noom—
lavatum= next the bath, and then
the European breakfast or lunch;
the first meal (ientaculum) not
being a formal meal, just as now
in Europe, has not been mentioned
at all.

126. Campum lusumque tri-
genem: another reading is, rabi-
osi tempora signi. Both read·
ings are so old that the passage
would seem to have been altered by
Horace himself, a thing which hap-
pens sometimes with modern poets.
If s0‚ one cannot help thinking he
wrote the one in the text last. —
Campum: the Campus Martius,
where such exercises took place. —
trigonem: used in apposition with
the force of an adjective, a not un-
common construction. The ancients
had several games of ball, but ap·
