HoRATI EPISTVLAE]

[Lm. 1.

’ asperitas agrestis et inconcinna gravisque,

quae se commendat tonsa cute, dentibus atriS,

dum vult libertas dici mera veraque virtuS.

Virtus est medium vitiorum et utrimque reductum.

⁷ Alter in obsequium plus aequo pronus et imi 10
derisor lecti sic nutum. divitis horret,

sic iterat voces et verba cadentia tollit,

ut puerum saevo credas dictata magistro

reddere vel partes mimum tractare secundas,

Alter rixatur de lana saepe caprina, 15 ι
propugnat nugis armatus: ‘Scilicet ut non

sit mihi prima fides et vere quod placet ut non

6. inconcinna, uncongenial. -
gravis: cf. molestus, Sat. Ι. 3. 65.

7. commendat, recommends,· i.e.
tries to make the great man prize
him by a show of excessive sim·
plicity‚ honesty, and franknesS‚
which becomes ill-mannered and
disagreeable. — tonsa cute, hair
cut close to tlte skire, as opposed to

the prevailing fashion of hair care· ·

fully trimmed, but allowed to grow
to some length3 see next note.—
. dentibus atris: such affected neg-
lect of one’s personal appearance
was intended to give the impres-
sio'n of an artless, unsophisticated
nature with the old republican sim·
plicity. ⁵ ’

8. libertas: i.e. a frank out-
spokenness which conceals no opin-
ionS, and hence is mistaken for

‘- uncomprornising virtue.

9. virtus est, etc.: Horace's de-
cision between the two styles of
intercourse is given in the formula
of .the Peripatetic philosophy, and
in accordance with his well-known
views. Cf. Ἔστιν ἄρα ἡ ἀρετὴ ἕξις
προαιρετική, ἐν μεσότητι οὖσα τῇ
πρὸς ἡμᾶς ὡρισμένῃ λόγῳ, καὶ ὡς ἂν
φρόνιμος ὀρίσειε· μεσότης δὲ δύο
κακιῶν τῆς μὲν καθ’ ὑπερβολὴν τῆς

δὲ κατ’ ἔλλειψιν, Aristot. Nicomach.
Etk. 11. 6. It is from this point of
view that Horace so often criticises
the StoicS.

10. alter: i.e. the scurra. Hor-
ace proceeds to describe in detail
the two kinds of conduct. —obse·
quium: cf. Cic. de Am. 24. 89 seq.
— imi: cf. Sat. ῘῙ. 8. 23 and note.

1 1 . derisor, tlte buffoon, such per-
sons being introduced to make sport
for the company. Cf. the scene at
table, in Sat. Ι. 5. 51 seq.

12. verba cadentia, etc.: as we
see them picked⁴ up and preserved
by Boswell, in his Life os Johnson.

14. parteS, etc.: cf. the imita-
tions of performers and ringmaster
given by the circus clown. These
are no doubt survivals of the action
in the mimes. For the relation of
the second actor to the first, cf.
Sat. Ι. 9. 46 and note.

15. alter: the affectedly inde-
pendent friend—rixatur: i.e. in
order to show that he is no scurra,
he contests every point, no matter
how unimportant. This class is still
found. at any rate across the Atlan-
tic. —lana caprina: proverbial for
a mere nothing.

„16. armatus: indicating *the
