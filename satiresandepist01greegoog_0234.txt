Elusus 16. This description of
Horace’ s villa, united with some
moral precepts as to the true source
of happiness in accordance with his
philosophy, is evidently addressed
to a young and successful politician.
But who he was beyond his gentile

‘name is entirely unknown, though

the name agrees with the person
addressed in Od. ΙΙ. ιι.

ι. ne perconteris, etc.: i.e. for
sear you should suppose that my
farm is a productive source of in-
come, I hasten to tell you that it is
chiefly a charming and salutary
resort for hours of retirement. We
need not necessarily suppose that
the estate was not a source of in·
come at 811, cs. I. 14. 2 and 26.
Horace is only answering some ex-
aggerated suppositions of his young
friend.

2. arvo, etc.: the five most profit·
able products os husbandry in an·
cient times, grain, oil, fruit, cattle
(cf. pratis), and wine.

4. forma et situs. these appar·
ently show at once that none of
the great products mentioned thrive
there. Wine would not seem to be

excluded necessarily; butas Horace ·

expressly says it cannot be pro·
duced (cf. Ι. ι4. 23), we may sup·
pose the exposure indicated is un·-
favorable.·- loquaciter ε indicating
thatnit was a theme he loved to
dwe on.
