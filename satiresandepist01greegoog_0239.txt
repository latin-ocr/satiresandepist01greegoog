‘Ipse deuS, simul atque volam, me solvet.'

Roman, as it would deprive him of
his citizenship and as good as make
a slave of him. — locum, the ranks,
in the technical sense, as a figure.

69. vendere cum possiS, ete:
τῖε. to be sure such a man is not
wholly useless; he may be tolerated
in society sor the service he renderS,
but he is only a slave after all.

70. pascat, etc.: these are all
employments of money-getting, but
they benefit society. —— durus: cf.

Ι. 7. 91.

is a virtuous soul. This thought is

presented in the form of a free
paraphrase of the interview in
which Dionysus in disguise defies
the power of Pentheus os ThebeS,
(see Eur. Bacchae, 450 seq.). The
only direct imitation is from v. 487,
λύσει μ’ ὅ δαίμων αὐτὸς ὅταν ἐγὼ
θέλω, which Horace interprets as re·
ferring to suicide. This is not in·
tended in the original, but is intro·
duced here in accordance with the
general doctrine of the ancients.

79. linea: referring to the chalk·
line which served as the goal in
the circus.
