rite cliens Bacchi, somno gaudentis et umbra;
tu me inter strepitus nocturnos atque diurnos
vis canere et contracta sequi vestigia vatum? 80
Ingenium, sibi quod vacuas desumpsit Athenas
et studiis annos septem dedit insenuitque
libris et curis, statua taciturnius exit
plerumque et risu populum quatit ; hic ego rerum
fluctibus in mediis et tempestatibus urbis 85
verba lyrae motura sonum conectere digner?

tion of mind in which the poet
worships Bacchus and the MuseS.
These words refer to the din, as the
preceding refer to the obstructionS,
of the streets.

78. rite: i.e. as he has always
been3 cf. 1. 19. 4.—c1iens Bacchi:
cf. Od. III. 25, esp. v. 19.

80. contracta: i.e. the narrow
path which needs repose of mind
and close application to follow it.

81. ingenium sibi, etc.: i.e. a
man under the most favorable con·
dition for study often comes out as
dumb as a graven image, and is only
laughed at. How then should Hor-
{²153 §3323 {5522} «ξῖ ἑὶζὲἒῗῗὲζῑῖἓ
at Rome? H e would be more ridic-
ulous in the eyes of the world than
the other. In other words, the pur·
suit of literature in the right s irit
doesn't pay nowadays among t ese
scribblers that plaster each other
with praise. — ingenium, a man of
talent, as often. ΤῘιε tone of these
words suggests that some notable
example is meant. —vacua8, de-
serted, i.e. by all actual life, the
home of quiet study.

82. studiis: i.e. chiefly philoso-
phy and rhetoric.

83. libris: dative3 cf. I. 7. 85.
The idea is of becoming a book·

tandem gaudio affici necesse est
sapientis animum cum his habitan-
tem pernoctantemque curis (Natu-
ral Philosophy, Ethics, and Dia-
lectics). Cic. T usc. V. 24. 69.—
statua : proverbial. — taciturnius,
etc.: εἶα. a mere day-dreamer.

84. hic ego, etc.: i.e. when such
is the result of a liberal education
in the academie stillness of Athens,
should I undertake to write poetry
in the very whirl of affairs, and
make'myself a laughing-stockefor
the public who do not understand
the necessary conditions of success
in so difficult a branch of art?

85. tempestatibus, the stormy
li e.

f86. motura, to wake, τῖε. to be
sung to the accompaniment of the
lyre. —conectere, to weave the web
o ‚ etc.

f87. frater erat Romae, etc.: i.e.
another reason is that one by writ-

must flatter‘ the other members of
the guild and so expose himself to
hearing their writings. It is im-
plied that this guild is composed of
persons who have no real knowl-
edge of what the profession really
is, and how much application it
demands ; cs. v. 109. The instance
is no doubt drawn from life.—
