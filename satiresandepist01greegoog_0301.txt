indiciis monstrare recentibus abdita rerum,

fingere cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis 50

Et nova fictaque nuper habebunt verba fidem, si

-word is made to seem neW, perhaps
such expressions as rubente dex·
tera, Attalicis condicionibuS‚
pronos annos (v. 60); though
Horace has in mind doubtless a less
lofty flight than is generally found
in his odes.. Cf. Persius V. 14.

48. si forte, etc.: i.e. though in
accordance with Horace’s descrip-
tion, the author will rely upon ordi-
nary words made fresh by combina-
tion, yet if occasion arises‚ he may
coin new ones in moderatiori.

49. indiciis monstrare recenti·
bus, etc., reveal by new sagas
thoughts hitherto unknown. The
figure is from the investigation of
crime, or the like. —— abdita rerum z
cf. Sat. ΙΙ. 8. 83.

50. cinctutis, half naked, or
kilted, clad in the cinctus, a kind
of kilt covering the middle of the
body, used before the more civilized
tunic.—non exaudita: cf. 11. 2.
117. -- Cethegis ε Μ. Cornelius
Cethegus (cons. B.c. 204) was the
first Roman orator (Cic. Brut. 15).
A time far back is taken to make
plain the necessity of new words on
account of the great development
of ideas since that time. Appar-
ently such words are meant as new
{iq‘rmations in -ῐειε, -alis‚ or the

ceptance,· properly, the ‘words will
gain confidence, and not be looked
upon with suspicion. —— si Graeco
fonte cadent ι apparently new trans·
lations from the Greek like the old
mundus, qualitas, exhibere nego·
tium. Horace's own exclusion of
Greek words proper, and his objec-
tion to Lucilius (Sat. 1. 10. 20)
seem to preclude the idea of such
words as malacissare (μαλακίζειν),
taken bodily into the language.

53. parce detorta: tle. slightly
varied in their use from their origi·
nals. Some editors take this to
mean a slight variation in the in· ⁶
flexions. - quid autem, etc.: τῖε.
this was allowed the earlier poetS,
and why not to the later as well?

55. ege, etc.: simply another ex—
ample of the same kind as· the pre-
ceding, only here is considered the
effect on the language rather than
the right of the poet.
