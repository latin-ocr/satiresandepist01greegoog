Q. HORATI FLACCI

SERMONES

LIBER· PRIMVS

⁴1·

Qui fit, MaecenaS, ut nem0, quam sibi sortem
seu ratio dederit seu fors obiecerit, illa
contentus vivat, laudet diversa sequentis?

Title, Sermones„ Though this
work of Horace is now universally
called Satires, yet the ancient title
see'ms to have been Sermones (con-
versations). See Introduction.

SATIRE 1. The main theme is
Horace's favorite one, of avarice.
As usual, however, he does not at
once attack the theme directly, but
comes to it sidewise, under cover
of a long preamble, which extends
as far as v. 28.

VERSE 1. Maecenas :this satire
by being addressed to Maecena5‚
serves as a sort of prologue to the
work, and dedicates it to him. This
address, as well as the interrogative
form of the beginning, gives the con·
versational tone, of which Horace is
fond—quam sortem: notice that
the Latin cong-tant& puts the so-
called antecedent noun in the rela-
tive clause, and puts that clause
first in order. This is, no doubt,
the earlier and more natural con-

x

struction, according with the origi·
nal interrogative character of the
Latin relative. Translate by chang-
ing the order of the clauses: “with
that lot which‚'' etc.—sibi: the
use of the reflexive is due to a feel·
ing of indirect discourse, whereby
the thought is put into the mind
of the indefinite person spoken of,
whose mental state contentus rep-
resents, and so implies a verb of
saying.

2. ratio, choice, as deliberate or
calculated (ratus).— dederit, has
assigned. —- obiecerit, has thrown
in lzis way. The preposition ob is
especially used of things happening
by chance ; cf. obvenio, obtingo.
The subjunctives are occasioned by
the dependence of the relative
clauses on the ut clause.

3. laudet, prazses the lot qs, i ..e
calls happy, or envies. The subject
is an implied quisque, suggested
by nemo. — diversa, defferent pur
suits (from his own).
