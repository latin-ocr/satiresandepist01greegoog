HORATI EPISTVLAE.

Hic murus aeneus esto, ⁶0

nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa.

Roscia, dic sodeS, melior lex, an puerorum est

nenia, quae regnum recte facientibus offert,

et maribus Curiis et decantata Camillis?

Isne tibi melius suadet qui rem faciaS, rem, 65
si possiS, recte, si non, quocumque modo rem,

ut propius spectes lacrimosa poemata Pupi,

an qui fortunae te responsare superbae

liberum et erectum praesens hortatur et aptat?

Quod si me populus Romanus forte roget, cur 70

erit. The whole may have had
originally a serious meaning, though
fallen m time to a mere singsong of
children at play. The precise game
in which it was used is not certain,
but see Plato Tkeaet. 146. A.

60. hic murus, etc.= the tone of
this sentiment is so different from
the preceding, that many editors
have rejected it as an interpolation3
and, in fact, it is almost im 'ble
to justify the connection. till the
two parts may have belonged to the
same song in Horace' s time, though
originating at different times. It is
also difficnlt to reconstruct v. 60
without the suspected words. Per-
haps Horacegives the words as his
own interpretation of the supposed
deeper meaning of the song. The
whole os the last part belongs
among the commonplaces of phi-
. losophy. Cf. Sen. Ep. IX. 3. 193
Cic. Parad. lv. 1.

62. Roscia: cs. Sat. I. 6. 40.—
melior: i.e. sounder, for the law has
a lower standard than the song,
as making precedence depend on

wealth.
63. nenia, old song, a word used

of any osten· re ted or rude song,
perhaps oriesnffipinnins sonem
as it was es y sung by women.

64. maribus, stur-dy, free from
the effeminating influences of later
times. — Curiis, etc. ι iae. such as the
old worthies used to repeat, imply-
ing that the heroes were brought
np on it and acted accordingly.

67. propius: see v. 62.-1aeri-
mosat used disparagingly of trag·
edy, as we might say, “ the mournful
play os Kotzebue‚'' or ‘⁴ the tearful
Stranger.” -— Pupi= a tragedian,
(perhaps deservedly) unknown.
cf. Sat. 11. 7. 88.
cf. Sat. ΙΙ. 7. 85

68. fortunae.
— responsare.
and 103. - superbae, arrogant, as
lording it over mankind, and ex-
pecting them to yield to her power.
Hence the resistance os the wise
man is more praiseworthy.

70. qxgaod οῗοέῑῗε an answer to
an imaginary objector who asks the
poet why he does not follow the
Ξῗιὲῗέἶξξωοξωξῗς 2352&ss 1132?
As he does not withdraw himself
from their society, why should he
refuse to agree with them? The
answer is contained in allegorical
form6 m v. 74 seq„ and continued tn
v 7 seq.
