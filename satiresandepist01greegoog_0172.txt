SATIRE 8. This satire is a report
made by Fundanius, one of Horace' s
friendS‚ of a dinner given by a mil·
lionaire of the time to Maecenas and
some of his friends, Although the
host evidently is depicted as having
more money than hrains, yet it is
not merely the ostentation of the
parvenu that is satirized, but the
misplaced diligence of the epicure
(cf. 11. 2. and 4). Nor must we
suppose that every fact stated is to
be taken as ludicrous any more than
in Sat. 11. The piece is only a
narrative, οξ which parts are satiri·
cal, parts are humorous incident,
and parts again merely the neces-
sary detail to make a picture.

1. Nasidieni (four syllables):
otherwise unknown, and perhaps
only a fictitious name. -beati, tlze
millianaire.

2. nam: i.e. I ask, for I learned
you were there when I went to in·
vite you myself.

3. de medio. indulgence in the
pleasures of the table was indicated
by sitting down early rather than by
staying late as in modern tirnes3 cf.
tempestiva convivia. —potare‚ to
have been, etc. (Gr. 276. a).

4. fuerit melius, cf. bene erat
ΙΙ. 2. 120.

5. prima: i.e. in the first course
(ferculum) exclusive of the gus-
tatio, -— iratum, cf. latrantem, 11.
2. 18.

6. leni, etc.: i.e. the excellence
of the viand depended on the
weather. This detail suggests an ex-
cessive particularity in these matterS.

7. cenae pater, (probably a jo-
cose variation on pater familias),
our respected host. — circum: i.e.
as a garnish. Cf. ΙΙ. 4. 75.

8. allec: cf. ΙΙ. 4. 73. Such stim-
ulating condiments are especially

grateful in sluggish and bilious cli·

mateS‚ and were much used by the
Roman epicureS.

10. puer, etc.:· these statements
seem to indicate a special elegance
of service. — alte cinctus: appar-
ently only a neatly dressed slave
(cf. v. 70).-acernam: the fine
tables of the ancients were made
either of choice specimens of wood
or of colored marble. Of course
there was here no table-eloth.

11. purpureo. a useless ele·
gance. -altert aspecial slave, called
analecta.
