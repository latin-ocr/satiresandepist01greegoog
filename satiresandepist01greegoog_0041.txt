11. 131-134, 111. 1-17.] HORATI SERMONES. 21

si peteret per amicitiam patris atque suam, non 5
quicquam proficeret ; si collibuisset, ab ovo

usque ad mala citaret ‘ Io Bacche ! ' modo summa

voce, modo hac resonat quae chordis quattuor ima.

Nil aequale homini fuit illi ; saepe velut qui

currebat fugiens hostem, persaepe velut qui ⁴ 10
Iunonis sacra ferret ; habebat saepe ducentoS‚

saepe decem servos; modo reges atque tetrarchaS,
omnia magna loquenS, mod0, ‘ Sit mihi mensa tripes et
concha salis puri et toga, quae defendere frigus,

quamvis crassa, queat.'

Deciens centena dedisses 15

huic parco, paucis contento, quinque diebus

nil erat in loculis.

5. patrie, tle. Julius Caesar, his
adoptive father. — non quicquam
proficeret, he would not have the
least ffct.

6. εἰ collibuisset, if he took a
fancy.— ab< ovo usque ad mala:
i.e. from the beginning to the
end, since the promulsis or antepast
consisted of eggs and the like, and
the dessert came last, as with us.
If we substitute oysters for eggs, and
dessert for apples, the translation
will be tolerably near.

7. citaret, would shout.—- Bac·
che z the e is used as long, as
standing in the original at the end
of a metrical phrase—surn-
ma: as the lyre was held, the
deepest note was above and the
highest below. Hence we must
invert the words in English, refer·
‘1⁰8³ ἴῗέἓὲἰῖἰῗέοἰῖῗ ωζῖῗὲἓῗῗέῑ

. , . .
dative.

9. aequale, unifhrm, regular,
consistent. — homini illi, about the
man. ·- qui: sc. curreret.

10. persaepe: sc. incedebat.

Notice the economy of words, where ·

curreret is suggested by currebat,

Noctis vigilabat ad ipsum

and its form by ferret. Again,
some word of walking is indicated
by the manner of proceeding de·
scribed, but its form is determined
by currebat.

11. habebat: i.e. in his train as
he appeared abroad.

12. decem: a small number for
the princely style of the Romans.
Cf. I. 6. 116.—reges, princes, rich
men, i.e. of his intercourse with them,
and of matters in which they were
concerned, indicating a life at courts.

13. magna, on a grand scale. —
mode, now saying.—tripes‚ three-
legged, as opfosed to the finer tables
with one upport in the centre
(orbis). — concha salis puri:
suggesting simplicity with cleanli·
ness and decency. There was a
kind of sanctity about the saltcellar
(salinum), which was in a manner
dedicated to the household gods,

15. deciens centena: sc. milia
sestertium, a million.- dedisseS,
suppose you had given or gave, a
hortatory subjunctive transferred to
past time.

16. paucis, a little.

17. erat, there would be. Τ11ε
