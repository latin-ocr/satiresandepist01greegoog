136 HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. II.

Ergo ubi me in montis et in arcem ex urbe removi,
quid prius illustrem saturis Musaque pedestri ?
Nec mala me ambitio perdit nec plumbeus Auster
autumnusque gravis, Libitinae quaestus acerbae.
Matutine pater, seu Iane libentius audis, 20
unde homines operum primos vitaeque labores
instituunt (sic dis placitum), tu carminis esto

the god of eloquence is regarded by
Horace as his tutelary divinity.

16. ergo: i.e. since 1 am thus
contented and thankful. — arcem,
my stron hold, with a reference at
once to t e heights and the secure
retreat from cares. Cf. Ep. I. 10. 8.

17. prius, rather, i. e. than the
pleasures of my country home (cf.
note to ergo, v.16). —saturisz i. e.
{aatttpgssfflffisthhsssshseiffssz‘1¹33
discriminate collection of thoughtS,
factS, and feelings (cf. 11. 1. 30),
and so may well begin with what is
nearest the poet’s beart—pedes-
tris: cf. Ep. ΙΙ. 1. 250.

18. mala ambitio, etc.: i.e. in
this retreat I secure at the same time
health of mind and of body.— plum-
beus, leadm, as weighing down the
body, making one feel lifeless and
inert. —Auster. i. e. the sirocco, an
especially oppressive and deadening
wind.

19. gravis, fatal, inducing feverS.
— Libitinae: in the temple of Venus
Libitina were found the undertakers
and all the paraphernalia of inter·
ment. The connection of this tem-
ple with death was probably merely
accidental, but in course of time the
name of the goddess came to be as—
sociated with funerals. Cf. Od. ΙΙΙ.
30. 7.—-quaestus: a fee was paid
at the registration of burials, and
- hence the autumn as causing death
was a gain to the goddess. Trans.
prqfitable to. The poet means to

say that this country abode is salu·
tary for soul and body too.

20. matutine pater, god of the
morning, apparently a half humor·
ous invocation used merely to ex·
{5323}ffit⁰gsssz¹5m¹3³hf1.·;.¹.ssz²ss.;
in addressing their gods (cf. Carm.
Saec. 14 seq„ Ilithyia . . . Sive tu
Lucina probas vocari, Seu Genita-
lis) he identifies his supposed divi·
nity with JanuS, the god of begin-
nings generally. The vocative is
used as the actual form that the god
would hear. Cf. Ep. Ι. 7. 38. — au·
dis, art called, perhaps originally an
imitation ‘of ἀκούειν but afterwards
thoroughly Latinized (cf. Ep. 1. 7.
38, and erat surdaster M. Cras-
sus, sed aliud molestius quod male
audiebat, Cic. T usc. V. 40).

21. unde . . . instituunt (= a
quo incipiunt), with whom (as the
god invoked) men begin, etc.—
ἓΡίἒῖἲῗὲ νέἓῖἓὲἔᾰᾴῗὲἰῗέἒ Ἔῖῗῗ
ticular idea is mentioned first, and
a general one including the first is
added. But the same form is also
used in English, and really has no
claim to be called a figure at all.
— operum refers to the thing to be
done, labores to the effort to do it.

22. sic dis, etc. i. e. in the
arrangement o’f the world this god
has this particular function of pre·
siding over beginnings (cf. Janua-
rius, and the temple of Janus in
relation to war).
