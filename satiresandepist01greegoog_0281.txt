Flore, bono claroque fidelis amice Neroni,

si quis sorte velit puerum tibi vendere natum

Tibure vel Gabiis et tecum sic agat : ‘ Hic et

candidus et talos a vertice pulcher ad imos

net eritque tuus nummorum milibus oct0, ’ 5
verna ministeriis ad nutus aptus erileS,

litterulis Graecis imbutus, idoneus arti

quin etiam canet indoctum sed dulce bibenti.

Multa fidem promissa levant, ubi plenius aequo 10
laudat venales qui volt extrudere merces

EPISTLE 2. Horace's friend,

FloruS, the same to whom Ep. Ι. 3
is addressed, being absent with
Tiberius on some expedition, had
complained of the poet’s silence,
and had demanded the ode which
had been promised him. Horace,
half in jest and half in eat-nest, gives
excuses both for not writing (vs.
1-24) and for not sending the ode.
The excuses for the last are (a) that
the stimulus of the ambition of his
earlier career is withdrawn by his
success (24-54); (b) that advancing
years are beginning to extinguish
his powers ( 5 5—57); (c) that tastes
are so different that it is useless to
try to satisfy anybody (58-64); (d)
that writing at Rome amid so many
hindrances is impossible (65-86);
(e) that the guild of poets is a
mutual admiration society, and if
he writes himself he will be obliged
to listen to their works as well. This
last excuse leads him to the true
attitude of the poet, and the true
spirit of poetry itself, the difficulty
of the art, and finally to his favorite
topic of ethical culture, and to a dis-

cussion of his own moral condition.
