HORATI SERMONES. 49

VI.

Non quia, MaecenaS‚ Lydorum quicquid Etruscos
incoluit finis, nemo generosior est te,

nec quod avus tibi maternus suit atque paternuS‚

olim qui magnis legionibus imperitarent,

ut plerique solent, naso suspendis adunco 5
ignotoS, ut me libertino patre natum.

Cum referre negas quali sit quisque parente

natuS, dum ingenuuS, persuades hoc tibi vere,

rest of the journey (if it continued
any farther) was taken by sea to
Tarentum, or Horace may have
stopped here.

SATIRE 6. There probably never
was a nation in which family pride
was stronger than it was among the
Romans, And this pride had its
natural accompaniment of mean
servility and vulgar striving for
social and political advancement.
Horace, of low, birth but recom-
mended by his talents to the favor
of the great, seems to have been a
mark for all sorts of attacks from
envious rivals and ignoble souls.
But his whole life and writings
show a remarkable freedom from
all vulgar social ambitions, and a
truly refined sels-respect and inde-
pendence. This Satire is an answer
to the attacks of his enemies, and a
statement of his creed in regard to
social position.

1. non quia: you do not Maece-
nas, because, etc. ,· this is not the
common construction of non quia
(not because . . . but), as the mood
of est shOWS, but the negative be-
longs to suspendiS, but is placed
in this emphatic position to show
that the reason for which Maecenas
might have scorned humbler men

did not cause him to do 50.-
Maecenas: the Satire is addressed
to Maecenas, both as a compli-
ment to him and to give it addi-
tional weight from the authority
of so great a man. — Lydorum:
partitive genitive with quiequid, a
colloquial and archaic form of
speech, though common in all styles.
— quicquid would have for its ante-
cedent an omnium or the like, a
partitive genitive after nemo. The
Etrurians were supposed to have
come originally from Lydia. Tbeir
origin is still a mystery, but the old
tradition is as likely to be true as
any other view,

2. generosior: Maecenas was
descended from the Cilnii, a noble

’ family of Etruria.

4. legionibus: used loosely for
bodies of troops in general.

5. nasu, etc.: i.e. turn up your
nose at.

7. cum, etc.: when you say that
it makes no dzfference, etc„ you are
convinced‚ and right& so, that, etc.

8. ingenuus: the inevitable taint
of slavery was still regarded as a
disqualification for social advance·
ment, even by men as large-minded
as Maecenas and Horace3 but the
son of a freedman was free from
that taint. '
