HORATI SERMONES. ι 33

Crispinus minimo me provocat ε ‘Accipe, si viS,
accipiam tabulas 3 detur nobis locuS, hora, 15
custodes; videamus uter plus scribere possit.’

‘ Di bene fecerunt, inopis me quodque pusilli

finxerunt animi, raro et perpauca loquentis 3

at tu conclusas hircinis follibus auraS,

usque laborantis dum ferrum molliat ignis,
Beatus Fannius, ultro

ut mavis, imitare.’

delatis capsis et imagine, cum mea nemo
scripta legat, volgo recitare timentis ob hanc rem,
quod sunt quos genus'hoc minime iuvat, utpote pluris

. culpari dignos.

Horace represents a challenge to
himself from the loquacious moral-
izer Crispinus (see 1. 120) to show
his skill in writing. At the same
time he disparages this branch of
skill by making a poetaster like
Crispinus excel him in it.

14. minimo, at great odds, lit.
with a very small wager on my part.

17. di bene, etc.: an expression
of thankfulness, —Horace' s auswer
to Crispinus' challenge. — inopis,
pusilli animi, with an unproduc·
tive (opp. to copiosi) and unas-
piring ᾁο99. to magni) intellect. —
quodque, etc. ε the full construction

would be quod inopis, quodque.

pusilli, etc. The expression of the
second quod with· -‚que thus imply·
ing the first, is almost a mannetism
with Horace. Cf. v. 115.

18. raro, in reference to pusilli,
perpauca, in reference to inopiS,
sieaking rarely, and very little at
t at.

20. laborantis, puffing away. —-
dum ferrum, etc.= only to com·
plete the picture.

21. imitare, imperative. — Fan·
nius, a poet of the elique opposed
to Horace, but otherwise unknown.
The sense is, “ Happy the popular

Quemvis media elige turba ε 25

poet, like Fannius, whose admirers
present him, etc.'' The poet now
turns from the criticism of Lucilius
to a discussion of the difference be·
tween himself and the popular poets
of the day, and explains why he is
not popular.

22. delatis capsis et imagine:
the natural meaning would be “ with
his writings and bust deposited ” in
some public place, as a library, for·
instance. It would seem, however,
that there was no public library
until the one established by Pollio,
and in that there was 110 bust of a
living author but that of Varro.
The best meaning, perhaps, is pre-
sented with, etc.

22. nemo: opposed to the pop-
ularity of Fannius, as indicated by
the preceding act of his admirers.

23. legat, reads, by himself. —-
recitare: the regular word for
public reading, which was the com-
mon method at that time of bringing
out an author’ s works. - timentis,
agreeing with the genitive implied
in mea.

24 genus hoc, i.e. satire. —
pluris, the greater part. In English
we must supply a verb, but the Latin
construction is a kind of apposition.
