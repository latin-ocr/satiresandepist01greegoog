HORATI SERMONES.

concurrantque foro tria funera magna sonabit

Nunc ad me redeo libertino patre natum, 45

quem rodunt omnes libertino patre natum,

nunc, quia sim tibi, Maecenas, convictor; at olim,

quod mihi pareret legio Romana tribuno,

istic of him, justifies the advance·
ment of the freedman colleague by
stating a quality of his which weighs
much in the minds of the people,
·but which you feel sure at the
same time Horace himself despiseS.
“sse man is a blatant popular
speaker, and has at least that claim
to the favor of the people.'' —- plaus-

tra: the he'avy carrying wagon of

the Romans, noted, and probably
named, for its creaking (plaudo).

43. funera: the funeral proces·
sion was accompanied with music.
— magna ε often taken with funera,
as only a great funeral would be
noisy; but as magna sonare is a
standing phrase, it is better to take
it so here (cf. 1. 4. 44), making
magna an adverb.
wo41i4ld qao} ο οοῐξιςῑῗαῒεὸἓῒοῖευζῖῗὶῃνῒε. -l-c}
cornua, curved brass horus—tu-
ba, a straight trumpet. ·

45. nunc ad me, etc.: after
showing the folly of political ambi·
tion, he now comes back to the
main idea of persona! and. social
dignity as independent of birth, de-
fending himself against the slurs
of his vulgar detractors.

46. rodunt, disparage (gnaw like
rats).—libertino‚ etc.: the repeti-
tion indicates a direct quotation
from his detractos, just as they keep

repeating it.

,.. .-

47. sim, the subjunctive as usual
puts the words into the mouth of
the detractem—convictor: notice
that this indicates only a social ad·
vancement as the friend of Maece-
nas, not a political preferment, which
he claims no right to.

48. tribuno: see life of Horace.
Sixteen (or twenty-four) tribunes
were elected by the people, and
were real magistrateS, but others
could be chosen by the generals,
and were called rufuli. This ad-
vancement was a matter rather of
favor than of merit, and was cer·
tainly so in Horace's case.

49. dissimile: here is brought
out more fully the distinction which

¹ underlies the whole: The tribunate

is an official honor, to which a low·
born man had perhaps no claim3
but the friendship of Maecenas no·
body has a right to envy him,
because that is a matter of personal
worthiness. —— forsit: only found
here, but no doubt another of
Horace's colloquialismS.

51. cautum: Maecenas' reputa-
tion for selecting only the worthy,
and those not from motives of arn·
bition (εἰ. to increase his political
influence and gain supporters),
makes his friendship still more a
tribute to worth than the friendship
of others might be.
