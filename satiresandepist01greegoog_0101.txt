71. saepe, etc.: humorous ex-
pressions indicating greater pains
in writing, as op to the care-
less style of Lu ⁶ 'us. This thought
leads Horace to descant on the
necessity of erasing and doing over
again one’s first effert.

2. stilum vertam the ancient
sti us, for writing on wax, was made
with a sharp point at one end, and
a flat piece at the other to smooth
down (inducere) the wax and oblit-
erate the previous writing.

73. scripturus, ιγ you mean to
write. -— labores, trouble yourself
to have, try to have.

work; it would be too refined to
please the people‚ for who'm a dif-
ferent style would be necessary. —
an: a reductio ad absurdum, as
often with an.

75. vilibus: cf. Ι. 6. 72.—dic-
tari: i.e. to be used as exercises in
teaching the ignorant to write. It
is probable, however, that it was
just this use of Horace’s works and
others that has, by the multipli-
cation of copies, preserved them to
us

⁶76. equitem, for the higher

' classes.—audax‚ undaunted, not

abashled by the displeasure of the
crow .

tame and decent for the coarse
