Quodsi bruma nives Albanis illinet agris,

HORATI EPISTVLAE.

189

ad mare descendet vates tuus et sibi parcet
contractusque leget; te, dulcis amice, reviset
cum ZephyriS‚ si concedeS, et hirundine prima.
Non quo more piris vesci Calaber iubet hospes,

, tu me fecisti locupletem.

‘ Iam satis est.'

10
‘Vescere sodes !’ 15
‘ At tu quantum vis tolle.' ‘ Benigne.'

‘ Non invisa feres pueris munuscula parvis.'

‘ Tam teneor dono quam si dimittar onustus.'

‘ Vt libet ; haec porcis hodie comedenda relinques.'
Prodigus et stultus donat quae spernit et odit ; 20
haec seges ingratos tulit et feret omnibus annis,

Vir bonus et sapiens dignis ait esse paratus ;

1 1. descendet τ merely of the
descent from the-hius to some south-
ern resort (cf. v· 45).—sibi par·
aet, take care qfhimseff by avoiding

e cold.

12. contractum, in a cosy corner,
referring merely to the poet's ‘⁶ cud-
dling himself up '' to keep warm. Cf.
Gravissimo frtjgore solus atque con·
- tractus Dormitantius mgrilabit in
lecto. St. Jerome, in Vzg. ξ 15.

Inque manus venit tritus de more libellus,
Neneffluid nugarum contractusque lege·

Nam rore Auctumni matutinisque pruinis
ll'rigiecgttnllia:³ intrabat male sartas aura fen-

Q. Sacram! (L. Sergardi, Am. 1650),
Satyrae, 4. 6.

13. Zephyris: cf. Lucr. V. 738.

14. non quo more, etc.= the
transition is abrupt‚ but is founded
on the relations of the parties.
Maecenas had been such a munifi-
cent patron to Horace that he might
seem to have a right to the society
of his friend under any and all cir-
cumstances. But Horace puts their
friendship upon a basis which ex-
cludes ingratitude in the receiver as

well as selfish arrogance in the

giver. The anecdote of the Cala-
brian host (no doubt a story current
at the time, and localized as such
stories usually are) gives an instance
of thoughtless giving merely of that
which is superfluous, without thought
of the character or merit of the
receiver‚ and without any personal
regard. Such has not been Mae-
cenas' generosity to the poet.

16. tolle: i.e. take away with
you.—benigne, no, thank you, like
merci in F rench.

19. haec porcis, etc.: represent-
ing the worthlessness of the gift to
the host himself.

20. prodigus et stultus: i.e. it
is the prodigal and fool wh0, etc.—
apernit et odit: i.e. cares nothing
for, and in fact wants to be rid of.

21. ingratos, etc-2 for naturally
where there is no personal regard
nor sacrifice, no gratitude is likely
to be felt.

22. dignis: tle. the wise man
makes a distinction in the objects
of his bounty, so that the gift is a
mark of esteem, and is prized as
such.—- ait esse: a familiar Greek
construction borrowed by the Latin
poets for brevity.
