HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. 1.

Praeterea, ne sic, ut qui iocularia? ridens ,
percurram, (quamquam ridentem dicere verum
quid vetat? ut pueris olim dant crustula blandi 25
doctoreS, elementa velint ut discere prima; ”
sed tamen amoto quaeramus seria ludo 3)
ille gravem duro terram qui vertit aratr0,
perfidus hic caupo miles nautaeque per omne
audaces mare qui currunt, hac mente laborem 30
sese ferre, senes ut in otia tuta recedant,
aiunt, cum sibi sint congesta cibaria: sicut
parvola (nam exemplo„ est) magni formica laboris

23. praeterea, further-more, or
to continue. — qui: supply the verb
from percurram.

24. ridentem, with laughter. —
quamquam, though, corrective to
the preceding, not strictly opposed
to tamen.

25. quid vetat? what law sbr-
bids ?-—pueris, children, the word
being used often for both sexes. —
olim, now and them—crustula,
cookies, tarts, gingerbread, evidently
much like our own in modern times,
though perhaps more elaborate.
The name is from their being baked
hard.—— blandi, coaxz'ng.

26. elementa prima, their A·
B· C’ s.

27. sed tamen, but still (though
we might with propriety go on in
this vein). —quaeramuS, let us
turn to.

28. Here begins the real subject, ⁴

but even here Horace attacks it
cai-efully, beginning with the excuse
of the money-getter. — gravem
duro: these words are intended to
heighten the color of the picture by
indicating the hard labor which the
farmer undergoes to gain wealth.
29. perfidus caupo: these words
seem out of place, as the context
would naturally have some word

referring to the jurisconsult. But
we may suppose that Horace aban·
dons the lawyer because, though a
good opposite to the sarmer, yet he
seeks honor more than money3 and
so in this place Horace substitutes
the huckster. Certainly the epi·
thet perfidus is more appropriate
for the latter than the former. The
rest of the satire does not follow
the same line of thought, but pre-
sents another phase of the dissatis-
saction of men, not with what they
do, but with what they have3 but this
is only the other side of the same
thing, and is the real reason why x
theyltd would not change if they
cou

30. mente, id,ea purpose.

31. senes, in t’lzeir old age.—
tuta, untroubled, i.e. by the toils
and dangers they have undergone
before.

32. cum, sibi, etc., when they
have heaped up a srgfficient store. -—
cibaria, lit. rations or subsistence,·
which Horace makes them say in
allusion to the gathered store of the
ant, referred to below. ’

33. parvola: inserted to set off
the force of magni3 not a merely
ornamental epithet, for such are
rare in this work, and are not to be
