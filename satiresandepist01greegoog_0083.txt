HORATI SERMONES. 63

At GraecuS, postquam est Italo perfusus aceto,
Persius exclamat : ‘ Per magnos, Brute, deos te
or0‚ qui reges consueris tollere, cur non

‘ hunc Regem iugulas?
rumst.'

Operum hoc, mihi crede, tuo·

VIII.

Olim truncus eram ficulnus, inutile lignum,

cum faber, incertus scamnum faceretne Priapum,
maluit esse deum. Deus inde ego, furum aviumque
maxima formido ; narn fures dextra coercet

were much given to coarse language
and rude abuse of each other, a ten·

dency that gave rise to two or three
kinds of dramatic composition, and
was not without influence on satire
itself. Here the passer· by is sup-

posed to call out to the belated
vine· ·,pruner “J’Cuckoo meaning
that the cuckoo had come. The
billingsgate of Rupilius is likened
to the rude torrent poured out by
the vine-dresser in reply. As often,
Rupilius is not merely likened to the
rustic, but identified with him.

32. at Graecus: inserted to give
the contrast of the Greek's fine wit,
to the coarse vituperation of the
Italian (Italo aceto).

34. reges: alluding to Junius
Brutus, the expellet of the Tarquins.
— tollere, put out os the way, like
Shakespeare's “ taking ⁰.ff·”
wh³3iy¹1³02531¹2²²r31521331¹3¹133 {³155 w¹⁵3
is so familiar to English ears that
the connection is suggestive. —
operum (predicate gen„ Gr. 5 214,
c), afitting task jbry ou· this rex is
a worse nuisance than any you or
your ancestors have removed.

SATIRE 8. This Satire is sup·
posed to be written in ridicule of

the same Gratidia referred to in
Epodes ῙῙῙ., VIII. 5, (Ρ) and XVII.
It represents an incantation scene,
in which the woman, by the aid of a
sorceress, performs magic rites to
recover the alienated affections of a
lover. This main idea of the Satire
is worked up with a number of de-
tails in Horace’ s manner, which
present the scene in a still more
ridiculous light. The eighth Ec·
logue of virgil may be compared
for the incantations‚ which were no
doubt common enough at that time.
As the fig-tree gives a very poor
wood‚ it is very likely that the
whole is founded upon a sudden
cracking of some wooden image of
Priapus m Maecenas' garden.

2. scamnum, etc.: i. e. utrum
scamnum an Priapum (see Gr.
§211- a). —Priapumz a not very
highly esteemed divinity of the fer·
tility of the earth, originally brought
from Lampsacus, whose image was
set up in gardens as half god and
half scarecrow.1t was customary
for poets to put into his mouth any
poetry too indecent for other spon-
sors, and here the abuse of the
women is heightened by making
him the spokesman.

4. formido, a terror, as in Eng-
lish. ——fures dextra: a sickle or
