HORATI EPISTVLAE. 191 ’

inspice si possum donata reponere laetus.

Haud male Telemachus, proles patientis Vlixi: 40
‘ Non est aptus ‘equis Ithace locuS, ut neque planis
porrectus spatiis nec multae prodigus herbae;

Atride, magis apta tibi tua dona relinquam.’

Parvum parva dqcent ε mihi iam non regia Roma,

sed vacuum Tibur placet aut imbelle Tarentum. . 45
Strenuus et fortis causisque Philippus agendis

claruS, ab officiis octavam circiter horam

dum redit atque foro nimium distare Carinas ·-
iam grandis natu queritur, conspexit, ut aiunt,

adrasum quendam uacua tonsoris in umbra 50
cultello proprios purgantem leniter ungues,

‘ Demetri ’ (puer hic non laeve iussa Philippi
accipiebat), ‘ abi; quaere et refer, unde domO, quiS,
cuius fortunae, quo sit patre quove patron0.’

It redit et narrat Volteium nomine Menam, · 55

40. Telemachus: cf. Odys. TV.

cando cum aliquo aculeo et ma-

601.—patientis: cf. πολύτλας, πο· ledicto facetus. Cic. Brut. 47.

λυτλήμων, laboriosus (Epod. XVII.
16 .

ΒΜ. parvum, etc.: cf. 1. 3. 28.
—parva decent: ele. the humble
life of the country remote from
courts‚ as opposed to the splendor
to be enjoyed in the society of Mae·
cenas at Rome, fit the poet better,
as a man of humble aspirations.

45. vacuum, deserted, as opposed
to the populous city. —imbelle:
peacesul, in reference to its luxu-
rious idleness.
=46. strenuus, etc.: the anecdote
illustrates the readiness with which
Horace would abandon his 'claims
to the munificence of Maecenas if it
is to be bought by the sacrifice of
his valued freedom from care. —
Philippus: L. MarciuS, cos. B.c.
91, famous as an orator. Cicero
says of him, multae facetiae (in his
orations); and, erat . . . in alter·

1 .
727. ab officiis: pleading causes
in the Forum or the like.

48. Carinas: the narrow ridge
on which now stands the church of
S. Pietro in Vincoli. It was not fau·
from the Forum, and was occupied
like other heights around the Forum
by the houses of wealthy citizens.
The seeming distance is only the
effect of Philippus’ age and the ste‘ep
ascent.

50. tonsoriS‚ etc. : all such trades
were carried on in little open booths
(tabernae).

51. leniter, etc.: the magistrate
is doubtless attracted by the carc·
less ease and contentrnent of this
humble man of the people, and
wishes to see what stuff he is made
of.

54. quo patre quove patrono:
i.e. if born free, who his father was,
