HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. ΙΙ.

ΙΙ.

Quae virtus et quanta, boni, sit vivere parvo

’ (nec meus hic sermo est, sed quae praecepit Ofellus
rusticuS, abnormis sapiens, crassaque Minerva),

discite, non inter lances mensasque nitentiS,

cum stupet insanis acies fulgoribus et cum 5
acclinis falsis animus meliora recusat,

verum hic impransi mecum disquirite.
Male verum examinat omnis

Leporem sectatus equove

Dicam, si potero,
corruptus iudex,

‘Cur hoc?’

lassus ab indomito, vel, si Romana fatigat 10
militia adsuetum graecari, seu pila velox,

molliter austerum studio fallente laborem,

seu te discus agit, pete cedentem aera disco ;

SAT1RE 2. This Satire is directed judge who has been bribed.— lepo-

against luxurjous living. The dis-
course is put into the mouth of a
sarmer, one of Horace's neighbors,
named Ofellus.

1. quae, tle. in its nature.—
quanta, i.e. in degree.

3. abnormis, outside the schools,
according to no particular pattern
or sect. — sapiens: in its technical
sense—crassa Minerva, plain
homespun wit, opposed to subtilis.
The figure is derived from spinning,
os which Minerva was patroness.

4. non inter, etc.: if one wants
- to study the subject of abstemious-
neSS, a richly furnished table is not
the best place for it.

5. stupet, is dazed.— insania,
senseless.

7. hic, right here, i-e. without the
disturbing influences mentioned. -
impransi, on an empty stomach. —
cur boet a question of the bearet,
which is answered in the next line.

9. corruptus: the mind of a
man at a feast is compared to a

rem, etc.: to have an unbiassed
mind one must be in the normal
state of hunger, which isproduced
by exercise.

10. Romana: these rude sports
are called Roman, as opposed to
the more artistic athletic exercises
of the Greeks,

11. militia: riding and hunting
approach near to the exercises in
military life.

12. austerum: the dry toil is
relieved by the interest (studio) of
the game.

13. discus: the quoit was a sav·
orite means of exercise with the
ancientS, not thrown at a mark, as
with uS, but for long distanceS, like
throwing the hammer or putting
the stone. — agit, attracts, lit. spurs
on.—pete= this parenthesis is
strictly independent· of the main
construction, which is si. . . fatigat,
etc„ sperne, but the added clause,
seu discus agit, suggests to the
poet the apodosis, pete cedentem
