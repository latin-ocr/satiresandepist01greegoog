‘ 76 HORATI SERMONES. [LIB. 1.
nil praeter Calvum et doctus cantare Catullum.
‘At magnum fecit, quod verbis Graeca Latinis 20

miscuit.’

O seri studiorum! quine putetis

difficne et mirum, Rhodio quod Pitholeonti

contigit? ‘At sermo lingua concinnus utraque

suavior, ut Chio nota si commixta Falerni est.’

Cum versus facias, te ipsum percontor, an et curn 25
dura tibi peragenda rei sit causa Petilli?

Horace’s critics, wh0, he implies‚
are incapacitated for criticism in
this matter because they never read
Greek, and don't know what they
are talking about—simius: per-
haps on account of his tricks which
he used to amuse society. Cf. 1. 9.
24 and v. 80. ΤῙιε reference is said
to be to Demetrius See v. 79.

19. Calvum, C. Licinius Calvus,

a contemporary of Cice10‚ and friend
of Catullus. The reproach here is
aimed, no doubt, at the prettiness of
their love songs. We can hardly tell
about Calvus, but Catullus was cer—
tainly superior to Horace in the
poetic gift. ·
' 20. magnum fecit: in the gen-
eral admiration of Greek literature,
no doubt there were men who actu-
ally thought the interlarding of
Greek words was a merit. Their
claim is introduced to be disallowed.
— Graeca: Lucilius uses whole
sentences of Greek.

21. seri studiorum (cf. cerebri
felicem, 1. 9. 11), pedantic block·
hcads, a translation of ὀψιμαθεῖς,
late to learn, and so filled with
the zeal of a new convert, putting
in at all times what they have just
learned. Cf. Gen. XI. 7.—-quine:
this difficult expression is the despair
of grammarians. The -ne abso-
lutely requires a question either in
the clause itself or in the principal
clause (cf. Plaut. Truc. 11. 6. 53).
But no question including the

meaning of qui seems exactly right.
It might be taken in the sense os
‘⁴ How can you think,” etc„ in
which case the -ne would only be
added to the interrogative as in
utrumne. Perhaps qui may be
indefinite, as in the Hercle qui,
and the like, os the comedy. In this
case it would mean, “Can yo‘u have
any idea? '’ etc„ and the expression
would be a popular one not appear-
ing elsewhere in literature.

22. Pitholeonti, an unknown
poetaster. Possibly Pitholaus. Cf.
Suet. J. C. 75.

23- at: introducing an argument
of his adversaries; but, you say.—
lingua: abl. of means.—concin-
nus, neatly joined.

ιι. chio: the Greek wines were
sweeter and less harsh than the
Latin, and hence an agreeable mix-
ture was made of the two. -notaz
the brand put for the wine. ΤΙιε
opponent uses this practice as an
example to prove the advantage of
mixing the two languages.

25. cum, etc.: Horace meets the
argument by reducing it to an ab·
surdity, asking if it is only in poe-
try, or will it hold good in oratory
also.—te ipsum, etc.= implying
that they themselves could see the
folly of such a course in a plea in
court. ·

26. Petilli: a famous law case
(see Ι. 4. 94) is used as a sample of
all.
