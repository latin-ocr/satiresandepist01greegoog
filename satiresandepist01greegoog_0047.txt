81. ligurrierit, gobble up, a very
common offence of slaves every·
where. Cf. “ Massa's nigger‚ Mas-
sa's meat,'' an old negro saying.

82. in cruce, the common way
of punishing slaves with death. -
Labeone: it is not known what
Labeo is referred to, but it is enou h
to guess that either his was a we l·
known case os insanity, or that
Horace, as often, gives him a thrust
gxugaasgrixgh ἰνῗοῖιῗὲεἱῖαἱοῐὶῗὲπὲἷρίἒῗ-
ance of a craze.

85. acerbus, embtttered, along
with insuavis after habeare.

86. ut Rusonem, etc., as the
man that owes kim money does
Ruso, evidently a usurer who had
unsuccessful litet-ary aspirations in
the line of history: This is another
of Horace’s side thrusts.

87. Kalendae: the first of the
mouth was the most common day
for ayment.

83. mercedem, the interest. —
nummos, the money, i. e. the prin-
eipa1.— extricat, scrapes together.

kamaram dreary,

89. porrecto, etc.. the position
for execution, as of a prisoner of
war awaiting his doom, a situation
which Horace no doubt has in his
mind in his description of the poor
man bored to death. It is, how-
ever, only a kind of passing thought
of Ιιίε, and not to be insisted on too
strongly.

90. potus, in hircups.

91. Evandri: there are two pos·
sible explanations of this name,
either as a famous potter, in which
case the dish is valuable forits in·
trinsic excellence3 or as the ancient
king, in which case there is a hu·
morous indication of its age. The
second seems the better. Cf. ΙΙ. 3. 21.

92. mea in parte catini: there
is no indication that the Romans
used plates as we do. They no
doubt ate with their fingers from
small dishes on the table which
stood in the centre of the triclinium.

93. esuriens, in his hunger. ⁶—
minus hoe iucundus, etc.: i.e.
“ Shall 1 renounce his friendship? ''

94. furtum feeerit, the technical
phrase.
