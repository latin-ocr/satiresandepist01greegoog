’ Eupolis atque Cratinus Aristophanesque poetae,
atque alii, quorum comoedia prisca virorum est,
si quis erat dignus describi, quod malus ac fur,
quod moechus foret aut sicarius aut alioqui
famosus, multa cum libertate notabant. 5

SATIRE 4. An answer to- Hor-
ace’s criticS‚ and defence of his
form of composition.

1. EupoIiS, etc.: he begins with
the origin of satire, connecting it
with the Old Comedy of Athens,
of which the three names meu-
tioned are the greatest.
th?0¹12?{zndssssssffiffffhsszifflz..⁰5
actual persons upon the stage in
order to cast ridicule upon them.

5. notabant, stigmiztized. See
3 62.4hinc = ab his.— pendet,
springs, i.e. he is an imitation of
them, and so hangs on them, or is

supported by them. (Cf. “On these>

two commandments hang all the
law' and the prophetS.’')

7. pedibus: using the hexame-
ter instead of the iambic measure.
⁴— numeris, measures, the same
idea in another form.

8. emunctae narie, of keen
sense, lit. with his nose free from
obstruction, so that his scent is

keen.—-durus‚ etc.: it would seem
that his critics had compared him
with Lucilius to his disadvantage,
and he proceeds to state the defects
of that poet.

10. ut magnum, as a great

seat, i.e. he regarded easy and
rapid composition as the great ob·
ject to be attained in art, rather
than elegance and polish.— pede
in uno: proverbial, not changing
his position (just as we say “ at a
sttriletch '') from one foot to the
o er.
· 11. flueret lutulentus, hurried
on with turbidflow.—tollere': the
figure is of a freshet carrying all
sorts of foreign matter iti its course,
much of which is worthless, and so
ought to be removed. (But cf.
Quintil. X. Ι. 94.)

12. garrulus, wordy.

13. ut multum: sc. scripserit.
— nil moror: a colloquial expres-
sion sor “I don't care‚'’ “1 don’t
mind.’'—ecce,·etc.: to show his
disregard of rapidity in writing,
