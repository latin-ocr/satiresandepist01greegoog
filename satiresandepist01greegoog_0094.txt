HORATI SERMONES.

X.

[Lm. 1.

Lucili, quam sis mendosus, teste Catone,
defensore tu0, pervincum, qui male factos
emendare parat versus ‚- hoc leuius ille,
quo vir est melior, longe subtilior illo,

qui multum puer et loris et sumbus udis·

exhortatus, ut esset opem qui ferre poetis
antiquis posset contra fastidia nostra,
grammaticorum equitum doctissimus. Ut redeam illuc .-

Nempe incomposito dixi pede currere versus

, Lucili.

Quis tam Lucili fautor inepte est

ut non hoc fateatur? At idem, quod sale multo
urbem defricuit, charta laudatur eadem.

SATmE 10. This satire contains
a defence of Horace’s criticisms on
Lucilius in Sat. 1. 4, and a general
defence of his own style of compo·
sition.
. 1. The first eight lines, printed
in italicS, are found in some but
not all of the Mss., and their authen·
ticity is denied by most scholars.
It does not seem likely from the
internal evidence that they are Hor·
ace’s work. It is barely possible
that they may have been originally
written by him, and afterwards left
out upon a revision of the Satire.
But even this is not likely.— Cato-
ne, Valerius Cat0, a poet and gram-
marian, of Gaul, who, we may
conclude, undertook to modernize
Lucilius.

3. hoe, so much, correlative with

uo,
q 4. illo: apparently refers to an·
other emender of Lucilius, after-
wards referred to as equitum doc·-
tissimuS. ι

ἒ. gibi-{2533 {geldlopassively
like many participles of deponents.
— opem ferre, come to the rescue of,

i.e. by modernizing and emending,
as English poets have sometimes
done with Chaucer.

7. fastidia, fastidious taste.

8. illuc: must be taken as reser-
ring to the general subjectos Lucil-
ius, from which he has diverged in
his talk about his emenders. But
the whole eight lines are very ob·
seui-e, and perhaps not worth under-
standing.

1. nempe, yes, or true‚· in an·
swer to a criticism on his remark
about LuciliuS‚ in Ι. 4. 8 and 11,
and opposed by at in v, 3.—incom-
posito, careless or rouglz measure.

2. inepte ε modifying fautor,
which is used in the sense of an
adjective. In translating‚ it is bet·
ter to make fautor a noun, and
inepte an adjective.

3. idem, he, at the same time.—
sale: used osten of witty satire,
but the figure is here made more
vivid by defricuit. It may be
imitated by made the city smum,
with caustic wit.

4. charta: cf. 1. . 104—1au-
datur: see Ῑ. 4. 1- , where he is
spoken of in the highest termS.
