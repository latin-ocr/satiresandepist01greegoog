HORATI SERMONES. . 79

Vergilio adnuerunt gaudentes rure Camenae. 45
Hoc erat, experto frustra Varrone Atacino
atque quibusdam aliis,·melius quod scribere possem,
inventore minor; neque ego illi detrahere ausim
haerentem capiti cum multa laude coronam.

At dixi fluere hunc lutulentum, saepe ferentem 50

plura quidem tollenda relinquendis,

Age, quaes0,

tu nihil in magno doctus reprehendis Homero?

nil comis tragici mutat Lucilius Acci?

non ridet versus Enni gravitate minoreS,

cum de se loquitur non ut maiore reprensis? 55
Quid vetat et nosmet Lucili scripta legentis

quaerere, num illius, num rerum dura negarit

45. adnuerunt, have granted, i .e.
given the power to write in that
manner.

46. hoc, i.e. satire.— erat: re-
ferring to the time when Horace
made his choice. —expertot i.e.
had tried it unsuccessfully, not as
those in the other branches in such
a way as to forbid competition.—
Varrone ε Ρ. Terentius Varro, called
Atacinus from the river Atax in
Narbonese Gaul, where he was born,
was a very industrious and copious
poet, who tried many styles of com·

position, but whose light was ob· ,

scured by the more brilliant men
who succeeded him. He was born
82 B.c.

47. quibusdam: such as M.
Terentius Varro, L. Abbucius, Ser-
vius Nicanor. —meliusz i.e. than
they.

48. inventore minor, i.e. though
inferior to LuciliuS.- neque ege,
etc.: the main point of the whole.
Horace was charged with ,Setting
himself up as superior to Lucilius,
and criticising arrogantly the work
of his master. This he here ex·
pressly denies.

50. at dixi, but I did say (Ι ad·
mit), proceeding to show that such
criticism is the natural thing in the
improvement of literature from age
to age, even in regard to so great
a genius as Homer. The passage
referred to is I. 4. 11, and the figure
is that of a torrent.

51. tollenda: the part to be re-
jected is even more than that to be
retained.

52. doctuS, learned critic, an
almost technical expression for a
professional man in any art.

53. So also Lucilius irnproves on
AeciuS‚ though in the line of tragedy.
-comis, genial and witty.

54. gravitate minoreS, inferior
in dzgnity, to the requirements of
the subject.

5 ς. At the same time Lucilius
does not claim that he is superior
to these earlier writerS‚ though he
criticises them.

· 56. Theresore there is no objec-
tion to Horace's following Lucilius’
example, and criticising him in his
turn.

57. illius, leis own, i.e. the char·
aeter of the poet's genius-re-
