Eius-rm ις. This epistle, ad-
'dressed to Maecenas, gives vent to
the poet’ s scorn, on the one hand, of
imitators, and on the other, of envi-
ous critics. Underneath the expres-
sions of seorn lies a defence of
Horace' s own writings. The line
of connection between the under-
warp and the two-threaded woof is
found in the implication that his
imitating admirers, as well as his
critics, suppose him also to be an
imitator of the same calibre as them-
selves; ,but some of them are angry
because he does not seek to con-
ciliate their favor, and so they de-

cry him ιιι public while they admire.

his works in secret. Hence he
attacks the imitators, shows that he
is not one of them’, and declares
his independence of the es of
the throng who have no guide in
art but the fashion set by the work
of the imitators of the day.

nest. Nor does he make clear what
use he intends to make of his text
until v. 17.— rizseo probably with
reference to e Old Comedy to the
writers of which Cratinus belonged.

Cf. Sat. 1. 4. 1. — docte. implying
that, therefore, he 1s a judge of litera-

ture, and will understand the scope

of the epistle. -Ωιιιιιιο, no extant

fragment of his contains the senti-
ment here expressed, but he seems
to have had a notoriety as a wine-
bibber, and an epigram has been
preserved alluding to this failing.

since the remotest antiquity, the
votaries of the Muses have been
drinkers of wine—satyris Fau-

* nisque: these deities are really the

same, the latter being the less gross
Italian representatives of the former.
The latter also had a prophetie
power which makes them still more
approplriate here. Cf. Ennius,V. 221.
