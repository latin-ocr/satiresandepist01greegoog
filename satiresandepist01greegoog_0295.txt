objects of wealth are not indispen-
sable is shown by the fact that many
do without them, and there is now
and then one who has no desire
for them. —est qui: probably (not
necessarily) the poet himself.

183. cur alter, etc.: the sugges-
tion of the difference of tastes leads

differ, the Lord who made them
only knows, but they do.'’ Cf. Sat.
ΙΙ. 1. 26.—cessare‚ etc.: ale. con·
tented idleness as opposed to hardly
won wealth represented in palme-
