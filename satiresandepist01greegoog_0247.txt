acriter elatrem? Pretium aetas altera sordet!
Ambigitur quid enim? Castor sciat an Dolichos plus· ,

Quem damnosa VenuS, quem praeceps alea nudat,
gloria quem-supra vires et vestit et unguit,
quem tenet argenti sitis importuna famesque,
quem paupertatis pudor et fuga, dives amicus
saepe decern vitiis instructior odit et horret, 25
aut, si non odit, regit ac veluti pia mater

man’s vehement obstinacy.-—scili-

, eet, etc.: Why! the idea that, etc.;

a remark of the ill-mannered fellow
in his defence, showing his misap-
prehension of the real case; he mis-
takes impertinence for honesty. For
scilieet, cf. Sat. ΙΙ. 1. 703 Ep. I.
9.· 3, 1. 10. 2.

18. elatrem. the word is pur-
posely chosen to hint at the brusque-
ness os his conduct. — pretium, to
buy me. —aetas altera: another
life, i. e. is it could be given as a
bribe. —8ordet‚ is too poor a gifl.

19. enim‚ well! or why. t ΤΙιε
connection really ιε, this vehemence
is of course justifiable, for the ques-
tion is, etc. — Castor, Dolichos:
gkapiators.— sciat plus: has more
s i l.

21. quem damnosa, etc.: in-
structions as to certain special rela-
tions„ beginning with the advice not
to imitate the patron in viceS, par·
ticularly in expensive ones ς for
though he have a dozen more viem,

means.-vestit et unguit: of the
care of his person.

plication of the word.

26. regit, wishes to direct. —pia,
devoted, the word being used both

toga, though beginning now to be
common, was still considered luxu-
riou5‚ and belonged only to high life.

31. Eutrapelus, etc.: an anec-
dote to show the folly of vying with
the rich patron. The person men·
tioned was P. VolumniuS, who re-
ceived this nickname on account of
his wit (εὐτραπελία, cs. Cic. ad
Fam. V11.32 and 33). It will be
noticed that the action here is a

pra⁷ctic6al joke, like that of Philippus,
