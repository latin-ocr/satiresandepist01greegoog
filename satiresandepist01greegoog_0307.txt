HORATI EPISTVLAE.

non secus ac notaS, auditorem rapit, et quae
desperat tractata nitescere posse, relinquit ; 150
atque ita mentitur, sic veris falsa remiscet,
primo ne medium, medio ne discrepet imum.
Tu, quid ego et populus mecum desideret, audi.
Si plausoris eges aulaea manentis et usque
sessuri donec cantor ‘Vos plaudite ’ dicat, · 155
aetatis cuiusque notandi sunt tibi moreS,
mobilibusque decor naturis dandus et annis,
Reddere qui voces iarn scit puer et pede certo
signat humum, gestit paribus colludere, et iram ᾗ
colligit ac ponit temere et mutatur in horas. 160
Imberbus iuvenis, tandem custode remoto,
gaudet equis canibusque et aprici gramine campi,
cereus in vitium flecti, monitoribus asper,
utilium tardus provisor, prodigus aeris,
sublimis cupidusque et amata relinquere pernix, 165

Helen, though she was the cause of
the war.

151. ita mentitur-z· τῖε. the fic-
tions which the poet introduces are
so united with the rest, that there is
no want of harmony in the treat-
ment.

1 5 3. tu quid ego, etc.: a recom-
mendation to the study of life, and
careful attention to the treatment of
character. This is closely connected
with v. 114 seq„ but there the poet
speaks first of diction as connected
with character, and afterwards of
conventional character, while here
he is treating of naturalness as drawn
from the study of real life.

155. cantor: in the manuscripts
of the plays, the final words or
“ tag '' are assigned to a separate
character marked ω. Hence it is
supposed that the person here re-
ferred to was the vocalist who sang
the arias or cantica3 but cf. Cic.

pgo Sest. 55. 118, and de Seu. 19.

157· mobilibus, etc.: tle. the
fitting charm must be given to each
character as it changes with chang-

164. utilium: i.e. of what is
good for him.

165. pernix: a callida iunctura.
Cf. Virg. AEn. IV. 180. For the
