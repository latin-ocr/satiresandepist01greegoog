HORATI SERMONES.

scilicet oblitus patriaeque patrisque Latini
cum Pedius causas exsudet Publicola atque
CorvinuS, patriis intermiscere petita

verba foris maliS, Canusini more bilinguis?

atque ego cum Graecos facerem, natus mare citra,
versicu103‚ vetuit me tali voce QuirinuS,

post mediam noctem visuS, cum somnia vera:

‘ In silvam non ligna feras insanius, ac si

magnas Graecorum malis implere catervas.'

Turgidus Alpinus iugulat dum Memnona, dumque
defingit Rheni luteum caput, haec ego ludo,

27 scilicet, etc.· i. e. to be con-
sistent, οἱ course, they must also
ask the great orator to use Greek
as well. —- oblituS, etc.: that is,
forgetting that you are a Roman.

28. Pedius· . Q. Pedius Publicola·

was a brother of M. Valerius Mes-
sala Corvinus, but adopted into the
gens Pedia. These two are types
of great orators. —- exsudet: a hu-
morous expression for‘ ‘work out'’
their difficult cases for their ora-
tions.

υἰζεῗέᾇῗῗε* <2222‘33202‘33 vat}
regular grammar would require eos
expressed‚ but it is readily supplied
from the names which have just
occurred.

30. foris· . i.e. from Greece. —
Canusini: at Canusium Greek and
Oscan would both be spoken.

31. atque ego, etc.: the answer
is supposed already to be given, and
the absurdity shown, whereupon
Horace makes the argument still
stronger by showing that it isn't
well for a Roman to write Greek
poetry at all. This he enforces by
‚a sable of his own case. It is prob-
ably true so far as the main idea is
concerned.

32. tali, the words in vv. 34, 35.

33. cum, etc„ an old superstition.

34. in silvam, ete„ a common
proverb, like coals to Newcastle‚ and
Γλαῦκ’ εἷς Ἀθήνας. The sable gives
him a transition to his own style
and his reason for adopting it.

36. turgidus: probably with a
double meaning, as there is no rea·
son to doubt the assertion of the
scholiast that M. Furius Bibaculus
is meant (cf.11.5.41).1f he is,
he was no doubt 5called Alpinus' ιιι
mockery of his poem on the Alps.
(see above citation).— iugulat.
with a double meaning, of a poem
in which Memnon, son of Tithonus
and Aurora, was killed by Achilles.

·The poem is said by a scholiast to

have been an AEthiopis.

37. defingit,muddles: i.e. by de·
scribing it badly, using no doubt the
epithet luteum. — caput ε probably
the mouth, but it may mean the
source. The former seems more
likely on account of luteum. —
haec ego ludo, i ..e “,I having been
advised not to write Greek poetry,
and not wishing to imitate the
tasteless effusions of Alpinus in
5532. {3322..⁰223321323525333}
to be recited for a prize, nor to ap-
pear on the stage. Others can do
