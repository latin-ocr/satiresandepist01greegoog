Debes hoc etiam rescribere, sit tibi curae

HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 1.

quantae conveniat Munatius ? An male sarta
gratia nequicquam coit et rescinditur? At vos
seu calidus sanguis seu rerum inscitia vexat
indomita cervice feros, ubicumque locorum

vivitis indigni fraternum rumpere foeduS,

pascitur in vestrum reditum votiva iuvenca.

IV.

Albi, nostrorum sermonum candide iudex,
quid nunc te dicam facere in regione Pedana?
Scribere quod Cassi Parmensis opuscula vincat,

- the pursuit of ambition and take up
philosophy, then his talent would
carry him far on in the road to
wisdom.

31. Munatius: probably the son
of Lucius Munatius Plancus, for
‘whom see Od. 1. 7. With him
Florus had, it seems, fallen out, and
had been reconciled (perhaps by

Horace himself).

32· at vos, etc.= in either case,
whether you remain friends, or
otherwise, I shall be ready to greet
you both on your return, for which
I have made a vow. The evidence
of his friendship for both and his
words in reference to their quarrel
indicate a strong desire to reconcile
them—a desire which may be the
kernel of this letter.

33. calidus sanguis, etc.: im·
plying that there is no real cause
for persons of such a character
(indigni, etc.) to quarrel, but that
their difference comes either from
the fiery temper of youth or from
want of experience.

Emsmz 4. Addressed to the
poet Tibullus.

1. Albi: the use of the praeno·

men is friendly and familiar. -— ser·
monum: the word includes the
satires, and possibly some of the
epistles. The mention of these, ex-
cluding the odes, would seem to
indicate that such fair-minded judges
were rare, and that Horace’s musa
pedestris was very generally disap-
proved, while his odes met no such
disapproval. This agrees with what
is implied in Sat. 1. 4, Ι. 10, and ΙΙ.
1. — candide, etc.: an expression
of thanks for Tibullus' approval.

2. quid te dicam, etc.: a collo-
quial form of expression, common
in comedy. — Pedana: Pedum, a
hill-city in the vicinity of Rome, was
one of the many favorite country
resorts of the Romans. Every avail-
able spot of high land near Rome
seems to have been occupied by
their villas. Tibullus must have had
a villa near Pedum.

3. scribere, etc.: i-e. are you
engaged in poetry or philosophy?
—— Cassi: a fellow-soldier of Horace
in the army of Brutus and Cassius
(Longinus). He seems to have
tried many styles of composition,
but here only elegies seem to be
referred to (opuscula), in which he
