HORATI EPISTVLAE. 297

Musa loqui, praeter laudem nullius avaris,
Romani pueri longis rationibus assem ⁷ 325

discunt in partes centum diducere.

‘ Dicat

filius Albini : si de quincunce remota est

uncia, quid superat? Poteras dixisse.'
Redit uncia, quid fit ?'
At haec animos aerugo et cura peculi 330

rem poteris servare tuam!
‘ Semis.’

cum semel imbuerit, speramus carmina fingi
posse linenda cedro et levi servanda cupresso?
Aut prodesse volunt, aut delectare poetae,
aut simul et iucunda et idonea dicere vitae.
Quicquid praecipieS, esto breviS‚ ut cito dicta 335
percipiant animi dociles teneantque fideles,

for the superiority of the Greeks in you could tell (is you chose, or the

genius. For it is their devotion to
liberal artS, more especially philoso-
phy, as opposed to the more com-
mercial education of the Romans,
that has caused this difference.

324. avaris: an anticipation of
what Horace has in his mind from
the first, that is, the sordid charac-
ter he is going to assign to the
Romans in the next verse. Of this
the Greeks had nothing, except in
tegard to fame.

325: longis, etc. ε i.e. what we call
Vulgar F tactionS, which would be
learned at a very early age; hence
the simplicity of the example.

326. dicat, εἴας an example of
the principal teaching at Rome.

327. Albini: as the name is not
a common one, it is probably that
of a usurer, as Acron says, — quin-
cunce: the calculation is in the
complicated duodecimal system os
of the Romans.

328. poteras dixisse, come: you
can tell. The teacher encourages
the pupil who hesitates sor a mo-
ment. This hesitation accounts for
the use of the imperfect poteras,

like). Cf. tempus erat, od. Ι. 37. 4.
—dixissez the perfect only for
metrical reasons. — triens: one-
third, i.e. four-twelfths.—-eu! rem,
etc.: the approval of the teacher‚
induced by the correct answer of the
pupil. But there is also a moral ap-
proval; for if the boy understands
fully that taking away a twelfth actu-
ally reduces the sum to a third, he
is likely to look sharply after his
fractional currency.

329. redit: is added, a kind of
passive of reddo. Cf. for red, also
redigo, used of moneys.

330. aerugo, gangrene, properly
rust: cs. Sat. Ι. 4. 101.

332. linenda cedro: ale. to be
preserved. The oil of cedar was
used to keep off moths. — cu-
presso: the elegant bookcase sug-
gests the value of the work.

333. aut prodesse, etc.: the be-
ginning of the topic quid deceat
(v. 308). This Horace treats under
two heads‚ as to instruction and as
to amusement.

335. quicquid, etc.: in reference
to the prodesse and idonea.
