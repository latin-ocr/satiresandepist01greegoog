HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. ΙΙ.

LIBER SECVNDVS

Cum tot sustineas et tanta negotia soluS,

res Italas armis tuteris, moribus orneS,
legibus emendes, in publica commoda peccem,
si longo sermone morer tua tempora, Caesar.

Emsm: r. In the life of Hor·
ace ascribed to Suetonius it is said:
[Augustus] scripta eius usque adeo
probavit ut . . . post sermones lec·
tos nullam sui mentionem habitam
ita sit questus: “ Irasci me tibi
scito quod non in plerisque eius-
modi scriptis mecum potissimum
loquaris. An vereris ne apud pos-
teros tibi infame sit, quod videaris
familiaris nobis esse? '² expressitque
eclogam cuius initium est: Cum tot
sustineas, etc.

At any rate the pqet’s personal re-
lations with Augustus seem to have
been of the most formal character.
He may well without hypocrisy have
joined in the praise addressed to
the restorer of peace and good or·
der, and he doubtless appreciated
his patron's many good qualities3
but in all his allusions to Augus·
tus, there seems to be something
perfunctory: “ If Alexander wishes
to be a god, let him be a god.’'
The tone of Epistle I. 13 is entirely
inconsistent with any unaffected per·
sonal relations between Horace and
Augustus, In fact, Augustus was
one of the class of men that Horace
was engaged all his life in ridiculing
and unmasking, an actor, a poseur,
a sham. It is entirely in harmony

with this view that Horace, being re-

quested to address an epistle to the
monarch‚ should have attached such
an address to this poetical treatise
on literary taste at Rome, a subject
in which Augustus was thought (per—
haps even by himself) to be inter-
ested. Nor was Horace so unskilful
an artist as not to be able to dove·
tail the treatise to its address with
a smooth joint. The binding pin
is the wise acquiescence of the
Romans in their present form of
government, taken in connection
with their dissatisfaction with the
present tendencies of literary art,
and its present representativae.
This was a subject in which Horace
did have an interest, and he makes
it carry the load of a tribute to his
patron, as poets are osten bound to
do whether that patron is a crowned
head, or a semi-cultivated Demos.

·2. moribus σακε, etc.: Augus·
tus took it upon himself to reform
the morals of the state. Cf. Suet.
Oct. passim„ also od. IV. 15. 9.

4. morer tua tempora, waste
your time, though the Latin has a
much more picturesque implication.
It represents Augustus’ time as fully
employed in the great duties of
state, each moment (hence the plu-
ral) devoted to some particular duty

from which he would be detained
