28. mire, it is marvellous how,
etc. The whole idea is, that one
disease has been cured by another.

30. lethargicus, ete.: the patient
suffering under a lethargy suddenly
has a paroxysm of violence and
attacks his physician, this being an
instance of one form of madness
driving out another.

31. dum, etc.· Horace in his
reply jocosely says, provided your
madness does not take that violent

circumstances. — angit: i.e. this is
the reason why you are about to
destroy yourself.

40. insanos τ containing the gist
of the whole matter. These people
before whom you are ashamed of
appearing to be insane on account
of having lost your property in pur·
