non magis audierit quam Fufius ebrius olim, 60
cum Ilionam edormit, Catienis mille ducentis

‘Mater, te appello ,Ι ’ clamantibus= Huic ego volgus
errori similem cunctum insanire docebo,

Insanit veteres statuas Damasippus emendo:

integer est mentis Damasippi creditor? Esto! 65
‘Accipe quod numquam reddas mihi ' si tibi dicam,
tune insanus eris si acceperis? an magis excors

reiecta praeda, quam praesens Mercurius fert?

Scribe decem a Nerio; non est satis ς adde Cicutae
nodosi tabulas centum, mille adde catenas ς 70
effugiet tamen haec sceleratus vincula Proteus,

blindness of the madman is shown
by these details. No warning can
make „him take care.

60. FufiuS, εἴας ἰῖ appears that
this actor on one occasion playing
Ilione, in Pacuvius' play of that
name, really went to sleep, so· that
he did not hear the ghost of Dei-
philus (the son‘ of Ilione and Poly-
mestor) when it rose and addressed
to her the words, mater te appelle.
Catienus was playing the ghost.

61. edormit, slept through the
part qs: a humorous use of the
construction in Ι. 5. 63, saltare
Cyclopa. — mille ducentis: a
thousand, with clamantibus, Just
double the usual number 600, con-
tinuing the supposition in audierit.

62. huic . . . errori: τῖε. not see-
ing what is really the case. All
who do not have right views of
things of course have a similar de-
uslon.

63. similem: sc. errorem3 cog.
acc. with insanire.

64. insanit, kas a craze ,· because
he does not set the right value on
such things.

65. creditor-t the one who would
particularly regard Damasippus as
insane. —- esto, well ‚· i.e. suppose

he is for a moment, until it is shown
by an example that he is not.

66. accipe, εἴας a supposed case
which shows that Damasippus is the
sounder man of the tWO, because
he only takes money which he cer·
tainly can’t pay back.

68. praesens, propitians.

69. scribe, εἴας addressed ἴσ the
creditor. “ Take all the securities
you can, yet the debtor will after
all escape you.'' The usual way of
paying money was through a banker
(a Nerio), and here the creditor is
to draw ten drafts on NeriuS, which
wou1d be evidence tenfold of ὼε(
payment. — Cicutae, a usurer‚ who
would of course be skilful in secur·
ing his debts. Cf. v. 175.
..lgadnssdsszi‘ssfflfflfflztssiiffi.
debtor. —mille‚ etc.: another more
general expression for the same
idea of taking security, but with a
reference to Proteus.

71. Proteus, the famous pro·
hetic sea-divinity who only gave
‘s answers when caught and bound,

and who had the power of changing
into all sorts of forms to avoid cap·
ture. The whole means simply, the
debtor will be more difficult to catch
