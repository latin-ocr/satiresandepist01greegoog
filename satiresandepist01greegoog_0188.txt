HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. Ι.

Quis circum pagos et circum compita pugnax

magna coronari contemnat Olympia, cui spes, '50
cui sit condicio dulcis sine pulvere palmae?

Vilius argentum est auro, virtutibus aurum.

‘ O civeS, cives, quaerenda pecunia primum est, ”

virtus post nummos!

Haec Ianus summus ab imo

prodocet, haec recinunt iuvenes dictata senesque, '5⁵
laevo suspensi loculos tabulamque lacert0. . ·

Est animus tibi, sunt mores et lingua fidesque,

sed quadringentis sex septem milia desunt ε

would of course wish to gain the
prize at the great Olympic games
as champion of the world if he could
do so without the trouble of working
sor it. In the same measure is free-
dom from desire superior torworldly
success (cf. v. 53), and this freedom
can be got without the toil of worldly
ambition.

52. vilius, etc.: i.e. as gold is
more precious than silver, so is
virtue than gold.

53. Ο cives, etc.= ale. but the
world thinks differently, and is bent
on securing money first, wherein it
shows its folly, as the poet proceeds
to demonstrate.

aronnd which the most important
money affairs were transacted, so that
the expression is equivalent to the
whole Stock Exchange, or all Wall
Street in modern times. We may
translate, “ the whole Forum from
the upper to the lower Janus.”

55. prodocet, preaches, i.e. prop-
agates the doctrine. -dictataz i.e.

given them as a lesson which they
thus learn and repeat, a method of
instruction very common, as it would
seem, in ancient times. Cf. Sat. Ι.
ιο. 75. —senesquez ale. young
and old go alike to that school.

56. laeve, etc. ε this line is doubt-
ful, and seems to have crept in from
the margin, where some scholar had
put it as a parallel passage from
Sat. 1. 6. 74. Stin it is possible that
Horace meant to emphasize the idea
that all ages are scholars alike to
learn this all-important Iesson.

57. est animus, etc.= an illus-
tration of the degree to which the
supremacy of wealth is recognized,
being embodied even in the consti-
tution of the state. — tibi: a sup-
posed case. — mores, character, for
good character, just as we use that
word. — lingua, eloquente, one of
the highest recommendations among
the Romans.

58. quadringentis: the 4oo,ooo
sesterces (8 20,ooo) required for the
equestrian census.
