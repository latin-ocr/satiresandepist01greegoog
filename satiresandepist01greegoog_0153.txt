non etiam sileas3 Davus sis comicuS, atque

stes capite obstipo, multum similis metuenti.

Obsequio grassare3 mone, si increbuit aura,

cautus uti velet carum caput ; extrahe turba

oppositis umeris ; aurem substringe loquaci. 95
Importunus amat laudari3 donec ‘ Ohe iam !’

ad caelum manibus sublatis dixerit, urge,

crescentem tumidis infla sermonibus utrem.

Cum te servitio longo curaque levarit,
et certum vigilanS, QUARTAE su* PAR‘ris UleEs 100
audieris HERES : ‘ Ergo nunc Dama sodalis
nusquam est? Unde mihi tam fortem tamque fidelem?’

Sen. XVIII. 65. Evidently this
was thought to be their ordinary
character, though Cicero maintains
that this is not the fault of age.—
garrulus: an example of one qui
immoderatus abundat. — ultro,
rather, εἰ. instead of pleasing,
which he hopes to d0, he will fail
to plea'se, and will offend the old
man besides,

91. non: here not different from
ne, though doubtless the construc-
tion is of different origin, coming
from the potential use of the sub·
junctive. Cf. Ep. Ι. 18. 72. —etiam,
either, properly too. — Davus: a
stock name for slaves in the com·
edy. Cf. eg. Ter. Andria.

92. obstipo, humbly bowed, prop-
erly, slanting, bowed and turned to
one side. . Cf. λοξός, Theognis, 548.

its connection with a participle is
more regular.

95. substringe, PTLCR up, prop·

“ erly, tie up.

96. importunus, spoiled or ex-
acting, in so far as he is inconsid-

erate of the claims of otherS, and

96. ohe iam: cf. 1. 5. 12.

97. ad caelum, etc.: properly a
gesture of supplication to be deliv-
ered from the excess of flattery, im-
pliedly‚ however, in this case half
affected.

98. crescentem . . . utrem, the
swelling wind-bag.— tumidis: ac-
tive, puffing (Ρ). Cf. tumidus Aus-
ter, Virg. AEn. 111. 357.

100. certum: sharffly, so as to
be perfectly sure of your aim. Cf.
certum seire, etc.

101. Darna: cf. v, 18.

102. fortem, noble. Cf. v. 64,
and 11. 1. 16, where, however, the
{affatumg‘gffssffizssssssffssssszt
and the stalwart virtues generally, is
very widely used to express the
highest ideal of a Roman worthy.
So bonus et fortis, the stock Ro-
man expression for a gentleman. Cf.
Ep. 1. 9. 13 ; Cic. Brut. 2. 6. For
the construction, supply quaeram,
or the like, which is regularly omit-
ted, cf. II. 7. 116.
