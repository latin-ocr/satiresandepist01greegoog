10 HORATI SERMONES.

[L113. I.

frontibus adversis componere? Non ego, avarum
cum veto te fieri, vappam iubeo ac nebulonem.
Est inter Tanain quiddam socerumque Y-iselli. 105
Est modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fineS,
quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum.
Illuc, unde abii, redeo': nemon' ut avarus
se probet ac potius laudet diversa sequentiS,
quodque aliena capella gerat distentius uber, 110
tabescat, neque se maiori pauperiorum

posed, at variana. — frontibus
adversis, utterly, squarely, diamet-
rically. The figure is drawn from
bulls and ramS, but is hardly admis-
sible in English. .
εεέξὲᾈῗῖἶέρῗέὲῖῗ is Ἓῗαὲἓὴὲῒὲ
ψ’. If this is taken, the meaning
is, “ Why do you always match (in
argument) things squarely opposed
to each other, as if there were
nothing between, setting only the
two extremes against each other,
and not, as you should, one extreme
against the mean.” It may also be
taken in the sense of put together,
i.e. identifying things utterly incon·
sistent and unlike, as not being a
miser with being a spendllzrift, and
not being a spendthrifl with being a
miser, whereas Horace shows that
there is a middle ground, and con-
sequently these things supposed by
the miser to be the same are really
utterly opposed to each other.

105. Tanain: said to be a eunuch
of whom. as of Visellius, nothing else
is known. — quiddam, α point, that
is, a mean, so that one isn’t obliged
to be either one or the other. —
socerum, etc.: a man we are told
who had the swelling of a hernia.

106. modus in rebuS‚ a just

measure in everything.— fines,
limits. Horace's favor-ite ethical
principle.

107. ultra citraque, on either
side ο .

1 . nemon’ ut avarus: a
troublesome passage of which no·
body can find the key. The mean·
ing is obvious, being the same as
the point in ν. 1, the discontent of
mankind. The difficulty is in the
construction. No authenticated
reading omits the ne (n'), nor
would the hiatus seem very toler-
able, though perhaps paralleled by
Od. Ι. 28. 24. But the ne is a par-
ently superfluous. If the ut c ause
is taken as the ordinary one denot-
ing a state of thingS, the ne might
be a colloquial usage like clauses
of exclamation, egone ut inter-
pellam (the idea that, etc.), or it is
barely possible to treat ut as inter·
rogative, how, in which case a pleo-
nastic ne might be justified; cf.
utrum ne. —avarus, in lzis greed,
added as the true reason why no
man is contented with his lot.

110. quodque, etc.= a different
phase of discontent is here repre·
sented. At the outset, men appear
as praising the lot of another on
account of its supposed ease, but
here, for its greater gain. Cf. note
to v. 29.—distentius, eto: simply
to express greater prosperity.
