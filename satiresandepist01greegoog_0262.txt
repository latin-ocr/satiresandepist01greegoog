HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 1‘1.

aestimat, et nisi quae terris semota suisque

temporibus defuncta videt, fastidit et odit,

sic fautor veterum, ut tabulas peccare vetanteS,

quas bis quinque viri sanxerunt, foedera regum

vel Gabiis vel cum rigidis aequata Sabinis, 25
pontificum libros, annosa volumina vatum,

dictitet Albano Musas in monte locutas, ·

Si, quia Graiorum sunt antiquissima quaeque

scripta vel optima, Romani pensantur eadem

scriptores trutina, non est quod multa loquamur: 30

this one thing the people are sound,
but not so in literary matters, in
which “theyaffect to prefer the old
to the new.

21. nisi quae, except those who,
applying, in translation, the state·
ment to the authors instead of their
works, as in fact Horace does. —
terris semota, passed from tlte
earth.— suisque temporibus de·
functa‚finislted their allotted exist-
enee.

23. sie fautor, such a partisan.
The nouns in -tor are so adjectival
in their nature, that they can take
an adverb, as here. In fact, almost
any noun can be restored to its
original adjective meaning, if it has
not been spEcialized too much. Cf.

· late regem, Virg. AEn. Ι. 21.—

veterum, of antiquity, neuter. —
tabulas: the Twelve Tables, which
constituted the oldest collection of
laws at Rome. . ο

16. 49 and note—aequata, made
on equal terms. — Sabinis ε cf.
Livy 1. 13.

26. pontificum libros: books
of ritual and religious law kept by
the pontifices from the earliest use
ofwriting. Cf. provocationem autem

etiam a regibus fuisse declament

pontificii libri, significant nostri

etiam augurales, itemque ab omni

- iudicio poenaque provocari licere

indicant XII tabulae compluribus
legibus, Cic. de Rep. ΙΙ. 31. 54,
where it will be noticed that they
are cited as authority along with
the Twelve Tables. — volumina
vatum: the most ancient works
of this description are the Sibylline
books ; but as these were in Greek,
Horace could hardly have referred
to them except by a careless use of
language. As oracles and prophe· .
cies were kept with great care, we
must suppose there were collections
of these preserved, which may be
referred to here. Cf. Religio deinde
(B.c. 212) nova obiecta est ex car-
minibus Marcianis. Vates lu’c Mar·
cius illustris suerat, et cum con·
quisitio priore anno ex senatus
consulto talium librorum· fieret, in
M. Aemili praetoris urbani qui
eam rem agebat manus venerant.
—Livy XXV. 12. 3.

27· Albano in monte: i.e. like
another Parnassus, a seat of the
Latin Muses—Musas, etc.: i.e.
that these antiquated wrifings, with·
out any literary merit, were uttered
directly by the goddesses of song,
sim ly because they were ancient.
