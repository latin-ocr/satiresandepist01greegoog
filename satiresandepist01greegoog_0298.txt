HORATI EPISTVLAE.

Humano capiti cervicem pictor equinam

Credite, PisoneS, isti tabulae fore librum
persimilem, cuius ,velut aegri somnia vanae

Scimus et hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim,

· EPISTLE 3. The best information
we have on this epistle is given by
Porphyrio: Hunc librum qui in·
scribitur De arte poetica ad· L. Piso·
nem qui postea urbis custos fuit
misit. Nam et ipse Piso poeta fuit
et studiorum liberalium antistes. It
is a rambling treatise on the art of
poetic composition, touching on this
and that point as it is suggested
by prevalent faults and fashions.
{gr the title, cf. Quint. VIII. 3.

1. humano, etc.: the first canon
is that a work should be consistent
with itself. This point Horace ap-
proaches in his usual indirect way.
It would seem that some one had
claimed a like freedom of the im·
agination from the trammels of real·
ism in poetry as was allowed in picto-
rial art. Hence he begins to answer
this claim by giving absurd- cases
of the use 'of imagination in paint·

ing. Then he introduces the point
made by the unrealist, applying it
to both painting and poetry, and
then proceeds to show its limita·
tions. The whole means», “as you
say, a poet is not tied down to abso·
lute facts any ‘more than a painter,
but a painter must not attempt to
represent the impossible, no rnore
must the poet.''

3. undique: i.e. from all sorts
of animals.-ut: introducing the
result of collatis. -— turpiter: of

appearance, its proper meaning.

Cf. αἰσχρός.

9. reddatur: i.e. to correspond.

10. aequa: i.e. alike to both.

12. placidis ε see examples in
next verse.

13. geminentur, united, so as
to make one creature.

14. inceptis, etc.: an example
of the disregard of the canon. The
poem starts out with a lofty design,
