272 HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. ΙΙ.

aut etiarn supra nummorum milibus emptum. 165
Quid refert vivas numerato nuper an olim?

Emptor Aricini quondam Veientis et arvi

emptum cenat holuS, quamvis aliter putat ; emptis

sub noctem gelidam lignis calefactat aenum.

Sed vocat usque suum qua populus adsita certis 170
limitibus vicina refugit iurgia, tamquam

sit proprium quidquam, puncto quod mobilis horae

nunc prece, nunc pretio, nunc vi, nunc sorte suprema
permutet dominos et cedat in altera iura.

Sic, quia perpetuus nulli datur usuS, et heres 175
heredem alterius velut unda supervenit undam,

quid vici prosunt aut horrea?

i.e. which eost a very much larger
sum.

166. numerato, etc.: i.e. whether
with money paid from day to day
for provisions, or paid earlier as the
price of the estate.

167. emptor quondam, the some-
time purchaser,· see Gr. ξ 207, note.
Here begins the converse of the
argument. “The lord of the acres
is in the same condition as you, for
he has simply bought his dinner
like you.''

168. putat: see Gr. 5 313 g.

170. sed vocat: τῖε. his property
rests only on an erroneous notion;
he calls it his, but it is not.—usque:
i.e. this is the extent of his claim,
“ all the way to where, etc.”—popu-
lus: the beginner will notice the

uantity. Theline of poplars forms

e boundary.

171. limitibus: means or man-
ner of refugit. -vicina, with the
neighbors.-refugit: this word has
been questioned, and seems a little
out of place. But to avoid lawsuits
by the marked limits of a man's

idea may then very well be ascribed
to that which marks the bounds in-
stead of to the proprietor. —tam-
quam, as i forsooth ,· introducing
the facts w ich show the folly ot
the proprietor's idea.

172. puncto: cf. Sat. 1. 1. 8.

173. morte suprema: cf. supre-
mo fine, II. 1. 12.—prece, etc.: i.e.
it is liable to be given away, sold,
stolen, or resigned at death.

174. in altera iura: cf. Sat. 11.
2. 134.

175. perpetuus nulli, etc.= cf.
nulli proprius, Sat. 11. 2. 134.

176. alterius: i.e. the first pos-
sessor, himself the heir of another, is
followed by his own hein—undam ε
the construction is rare, but the
accusative is governed by the prepo-
sition in composition, perhaps a col·
loquial irregularity.

177. vici: apparently used for the
{i‘c'ufib'ssfflss‘liiii} {³⁸5² ‘ffii 053
occurs in this sense in Cicero’s let-
ters», it may be colloquial. —horrea ε
as representing great omps—Cal·
abris, Lucani: representing great
flocks in pastures. Cf. Epod. I. 27.
