HORATI SERMONES. 43

Ora manusque tua lavimUS, Feronia, lympha.

Milia tum pransi tria repimus, atque subimus 25
impositum saxis late candentibus Anxur.

Huc venturus erat MaecenaS, optimus atque

CocceiuS, missi magnis de rebus uterque

legati, aversos soliti componere amicos,

Hic oculis ego nigra meis collyria lippus > 30

illinere.

Interea Maecenas advenit atque

CocceiuS, Capitoque simul FonteiuS,·ad unguem
factus hom0, Antoni, non ut magis alter, amicuS.
Fundos Aufidio Lusco praetore libenter

loquial expression. - vix demum,
at last and hardly them—quarta
hora: about ten o'clock, though the
distance was less than twenty miles.

24. Feroniae an old Italian
divinity of uncertain attributes and
functions. She had a sacred grove
and fountain on the Appian Way,
Α, at> the end of the canal, where Hor·
ace lauded, made his morning toilet,
and took his breakfast.

2 5. subimus: Tarracina (Anxur)
was situated on a high rocky hill
on the sea. 'Hence the use of sub,
and of impositum, etc.

27. huc, etc.: apparently the
dignitaries came by some rapid con·

veyance on the Appian Way, or>

they may have been already in the
neighborhood, and were met by the
poet at Tarracina, where the Appian
turns eastward ,away from the coast.

28. Cocceius, L. Cocceius Ner·
va, the great-grandfather of the Em-
peror Nerva. He, as well as Mae-
cenas, was a friend of Octavian, and
had in B.c. 40 assisted in arranging
the Peuce of Brundisium. (See In·
troduction to this Satire.) Hence
soliti, v. 29.

30. hie oculis, etc.: a detail like
that in v. 48. The poet consumes
the time iu medical treatment.

32. Capito: Fonteius Capito,
who assisted in the embassy as a
friend and partisan of Antonius.
He remained with the latter and
assisted him in the contest later. —
ad unguem: a proverbial expres·

.sion drawn from trying the surface

of marble and wood with the -nail;
perfect to a hair.

33. ut, sc. esset or est.

pian Way. — praetore: the name
of the man and his office are inserted

in the form of a date, as if he were ·

important enough to give his name
to the year like the consuls. Origi-
nally praetor was the Italian name
for the highest magistrate of an in-
dependent city 3 and some cities
were allowed to retain the old name
after their subjugation by the Ro·
manS, though generally such magis·
trates were called duoviri. The
person here seems to have made
himself ridiculous by putting on the
airs of a consul, assuming the hon-
ors (praemia) of that office‚— the
toga praetexta with its crimson bor·
der, the broad crimson stripe on the
front of the tunic, and further, what
does not seem to have been used
by the consul, a pan of charcoal
