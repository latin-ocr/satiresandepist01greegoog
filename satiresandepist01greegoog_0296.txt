HORA'H EPISTVLAE.

tollam, nec metuam quid de me iudicet heres

quod non plura datis invenerit3 et tamen idem

scire volam, quantum simplex hilarisque nepoti
discrepet et quantum discordet parcus avar0.

Distat enim, spargas tua prodigus, an neque sumptum 195
invitus facias, neque plura parare laboreS‚

ac potiuS, puer ut festis Quinquatribus olim,

exiguo gratoque fruaris tempore raptim.

· Pauperies immunda domus procul absit, ego utrum

nave ferar magna an parva, ferar unus et idem.'

Non agimur tumidis velis Aquilone secundO,

so far as it is manifest in various
characters of individuaIS. -albua
et aterz vaguely used as well for
character as destiny.

190. utar, etc.: the mention of
the two extremes of sels-indulgence
and avarice leads Horace as usual
to proclaim his doctrine of the mid·
dle course between prodigality and
hoarding. There is an emphasis on
”misy-⁹ 1³5³{51i‘1‘ssh0} 530552‘25.
to increase. Cf. Sat. I. 1. 51.

192. plura datis, more left kint,
literally‚ more than what is left. Cf.
Ι. . 13.

393. scire volam: i.e. to realize,
and act accordingly. — simplex,
s ῗζέἑιῒῖςῐὲῑε ἓῗὲεῗὲεῗξέςεῖἳὲἓωᾚῖ
ing to which the man would be
after the main chance through all
his actions, — hilaria, the cheerful
spirit, as opposed to the prodigal.

195. spargas, etc. ε like the
nepos.—neque sumptum, etc.:
like the free-handed and unavari-
cious hilaris and simplex.

197. uer, etc.: τῖε. act like a
hoy in t e holidays, enjoying to the
full the brief time allotted to enjoy-
ment. This is opposed to parare,

and is a part of the alternative with
an.—raptim: tle. making haste
to enjoy, on account of the brevity
of the time.

199. pauperiem etc.: i.e.if only
1 am free from want, the amount
of my possessions is immaterial.—-
domus procul: a genitive of sepa-
ration after the manner of the Greek .
But the reading is doubtful. Some
editors simplisy matters by omitting
domus and inserting mod0.-pau·
peries: not absolute want, but
straitened circumstanceS, such as to
deprive the poet of the elegancies
(munditiae) of a refined life. —
immunda, squalid or unre ned.—
utrum nave, etc.: a short and ex-
pression, where, asin so many cases,
the figure is confused with the ob·
ject. “I care not whether 1 am
rich or poor, but shall live my life
in either case, just as 1 should not
care whether 1 went in a big shi
or a little one, for 1 should finis
my journey essentially the same.''
The idea on which the double ques·
tion depends is implied in ferar
unus et idem.

201. non agimur, etc.: keeping
up the figure of the voyage. — tumi-
dis, etc.: i.e. in prosperity 1 cannot
