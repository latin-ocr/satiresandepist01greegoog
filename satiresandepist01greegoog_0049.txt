HORATI SERMONES. 29

nominaque invenere ; dehinc absistere bello,

oppida coeperunt munire et ponere legeS, 105
ne quis fur esset, neu latr0, neu quis adulter.

Nam fuit ante Helenam cunnus taeterrima belli

causa3 sed ignotis perierunt mortibus illi,

quos venerem incertam rapientis more ferarum

viribus editior caedebat, ut in grege taurus, κιο
Iura inventa metu iniusti fateare necesse est,

tempora si fastosque velis evolvere mundi.

Nec natura potest iusto secernere iniquum,

dividit ut bona diversis, fugienda petendis ;

nec vincet ratio hoc, tantundem ut peccet idemque 115
qui teneros caules, alieni fregerit horti,

et qui nocturnus sacra divom legerit.

ceptions.

104. dehinc, etc.: i-e. as soon as
language made association possible,

mutual rights and individual prop·

themselves in the possession of the
means for this satisfaction.

107. nam fuit, etc.: explanatory
of neu quis adulter. For lust
must have caused war long before

rights were violated‚ and the wars
were never celebrated in song.

same sense as the preceding, but ,
more technical.

being derived from punishment in-
flicted by the vote of the people, to
