HORATI SERMONES. 41

dearth of public interests literature
had become the fashionable employ-
ment of the day, and everybody
wrote poetry that could write and
spell. (Cf. Ep. ΙΙ. 1. 108.)

143. Iudaei: the Jews were fa-
mous with the ancients for their
energy in proselyting.

ἃ· SA'1‘1RE 5. This satire describes
a journey of the poet from Rome
to Brundisium, and is imitated from
a similar work of Lucilius, The
occasion of the journey has been
somewhat disputed. Horace went,
as was usual in those timeS, as a
companion in the suite of his noble
patronS, on an embassy to arrange
terms between Octavianus (Augus-
tus) and Antonius. There were
two such embassies. One was in
40 B.C., which met Antonius at
Brundisium, and concluded the so·
called Peace of Brundisium, by

which Antonius received Octavia, .

the sister of AugustuS, as his wife,
and the domains of the state were
divided between the two parties.
The other was in 13.C. 37, which
actually went to Tarentum, but was
originally intended for Brundisium.
By this treaty Antonius lent assist-
ance to Augustus against Sex. Pom-
pey, who had renewed hostilities
since the preceding peace. On both
these occasions Maecenas was pres-
ent, and the journey described might
be on either, but it is more probable
that it was the latter. See Kirch-
ner, Quaest. Horat. I. 54. Τὴθ

interest of the work is chiefly anti·
quarian, rather than literary, except
so far as it gives some light upon
Horace’s person and character. But
from the personal interest felt in the
poet the Satire has always been a
favorite 3 and indeed, in the scarcity
of unaffected personal narrative of
ancient times, may well be so still.
1. Aricia, the first stopping-place
for the night on the Appian Way,
sixteen Roman miles (not quite

fifteen of ours) south by east of ,L

Rome.

2. hospitio, quarters, no doubt
a public house.

3. doctissimus ε probably a
friendly overestimate, as no account
of him has come down to us with
all his learning.— Forum Appi:
twenty Roman miles on the same
road, at the head of the canal through '
the Pomptine MarsheS. Thus far >
Horace and his companion seem to
have travelled on foot, while the
other members of the party drove
and met them, some at Appii Forum
(cf. comites, v, 9), and some at
Anxur.

4. malignis: as if their cheat-
ing was from enmity to the human
race. Cf. Tony Weller’s estimate of
pike keepers.

5. divisimus, i.e. taking two
days for it instead of one.— altius
praecinctis: as the clothing of the
ancients was long and flowing,
“ girding up the loins '' was a symbol
of activity and energy, as appears by
the contrasted ignavi and tardis.
