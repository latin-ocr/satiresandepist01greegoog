virtus atque animus cenis responsat opimis?
Obsequium ventris mihi perniciosius est cur?

Tergo plector enim. Qui tu impunitior illa, 105
quae parvo sumi nequeunt, obsonia captas?

Nempe inamarescunt epulae sine fine petitae,

illusique pedes vitiosum serre recusant

corpus, An hic peccat, sub noctem qui puer uvam
furtiva mutat strigili3 qui praedia vendit, 110
nil servile, gulae parem, habet? Adde, quod idem

non horam tecum esse potes, non otia recte

ponere, teque ipsum vitaS‚ fugitivus et err0,

iam vino quaerens, iam somno fallere curam:

frustra: nam comes atra premit sequiturque fugacem. 115

Η Unde mihi lapidem?

H. Unde sagittas?

D. Aut insanit hom0, aut versus facit. H. Ocius hinc te
ni rapis, accedes opera agro nona Sabino!

D. Quorsum est opus?

than you?

32: nstnfiiffaffffffaa,
to close the satire without forcing,
represents himself as enraged (cf.
11. 3. 323), and stopping the dia·

tribe by a threat of punishment,
which is of course an admission of
its trumo-lapidem·cf.11.5.102.

117. insanit. the allusion is to
the other Stoic paradox, as in 11. 3.
The suggestion of insanity is in the
similarity of Horace's cry to that of
some insane person on the stage, so
that Horace is either crazy himself
or writing a tragedy to represent
Ajax or some similar person, which

the farm, a common punishment of
city slaves, Cf. Plaut. Mostell. Ι.
