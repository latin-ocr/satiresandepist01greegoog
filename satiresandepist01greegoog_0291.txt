HORATI EPISTVLAE.

269

levabit cultu, virtute carentia tollet,

ludentis speciem dabit et torquebitur ut qui

nunc Satyrum, nunc agrestem Cyclopa movetur. 125
Praetulerim scriptor delirus inersque videri,

dum mea delectent mala me vel denique fallant,

quam sapere et ringi? Fuit haud ignobilis Argis,

qui se credebat miros audire tragoedOS,

in vacuo laetus sessor plausorque theatro, 130
cetera qui vitae servaret munia recto

more, bonus sane vicinuS, amabilis hospeS,

comis in uxorem, posset qui ignoscere servis

et signo laeso non insanire lagenae,

posset qui rupem et puteum vitare patentem. 135

111. 26. 1043 but cf. Sat. Ι. 4. 11.

124. ludentis, etc.: i.e. the re-
sult will be apparently an easy style
and a light touch, which, however,
the writer can gaiu only by a seri·
ous effort.

125. Satyrum, etc.: i.e. a pan-
tomimic actor persor-ming a part
which seems comio to the specta-

κριβῶσθαι, ὣς εἶναι τὸ πᾶν εὔρυθμον,
εὔμορφον, σύμμετρον, αὐτὸ αὐτῷ· ἐοι-
κὸς ἀσυκοφάντητον, ἀνεπίληπτον,
μηδαμῶς ἐλλιπὲς, ἐκ τῶν ἀρίστων

the day than to have sound ideas
and suffer the consequent worry. —

rance of what has just been laid
down as mles—iners: i.e. clumsy
in his efforts to write. -— scriptor,
as an author, i.e. if 1 should write.

are put, naturally, in the opposite
order.

count of his own imperfectionS.—
fuit, etc. ε an anecdote showing that
sometimes a delusion is more com-
fortable than a sound mind.

sanity in all other respects.—-ser·
