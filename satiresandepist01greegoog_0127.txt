unguere si caulis oleo meliore caputque 125
coeperis impexa foedum porrigine? Quare,

si quidvis satis est, periuraS‚ surripiS, aufers

undique? Tun’ sanus? Populum si caedere saxis
incipias servosve tuos quos aere parariS,

insanum te omnes pueri clamentque puellae: 130
cum laqueo uxorem interimis matremque venene,
incolumi capite es? Quid enim? Neque tu hoc facis

ArgiS,

nec ferro ut demens genetricem ‚occidis Orestes,

An tu reris eum occisa insanisse parente,

ac non ante malis dementem actum Furiis quam 135
in matris iugulo ferrum tepefecit acutum ?

Quin, ex quo est habitus male tutae mentis OresteS,

nil sane fecit quod tu reprehendere possis: ”

‘non Pyladen ferro violare aususve sororem

Electram, tantum maledicit utrique, vocando 140
hanc Furiam, hunc aliud, iussit quod splendida bilis.
Pauper Opimius argenti positi intus et auri,

127. quidvis, i. e. so little as you
use.

128. populum, etc.: i. e. the
crimes he commits for the sake of
money are as much marks of' insanity
as the conduct described would be.

130. pueri, puellae. proverbial,
i. e. everybody

132. quid enim? why yes (cf. Ι.
1. 7), adopting the miser’ s view
ironically. — neque tu, etc.. the
miser would argue that he was not
insane, because in their ignorance
of the true essence of human con·
duct men take the accidents of
place, time, and circumstance, for
the real characteristics of those
actions which are held to be insane,
as in the case of Orestes, Because
the deed is not done at ArgOS, nor

with the sword, it is not insane like
that of Orestes.

134. an tu reris, etc.: i.e. (am
Ι not right in my interpretation of
the matter ?) or do you suppose that
Orestes went mad only after killing
his mother? The Stoic doctrine
makes all criminal conduct evidence
of insanity in itself. In fact, after
his crime, Orestes did nothing that
could be called insane at all. All
this goes to prove the Stoic doc-
trine, that all misconduct is insane.

142. pauper, etc.: another exam-
ple to show the insanity of avarice.
Opimius is called poor, because,
with all his wealth, he acts like a
poor man. — argenti. Horace’ s fa·
