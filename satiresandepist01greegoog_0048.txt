28 HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. Ι.

prodiderit commissa fide sponsumve negarit? 95
Quis paria esse fere placuit peccata, laborant

cum ventum ad verum est ; sensus moresque repugnant

atque ipsa utilitas, iusti prope mater et aequi.

Cum prorepserunt primis animalia terris,

mutum et turpe pecus, glandem atque cubilia propter 100

unguibus et pugniS‚ dein fustibuS, atque ita porro

pugnabant armiS, quae post fabricaverat usuS,

donec verba, quibus voces sensusque notarent,

95. commissa fide (dat), 'a
trust. The two classes of offences
are of course made as different in
enormity-as possible, to bring out
more fully the absurdity of the
Stoic paradox in v. 96.

96. quis ι the constant use of this

old form in the satires is an indica·
’ tion of their colloquial character.—
The connection of thought is:
Such offences are recognized as
of different magnitude by every
one, and though the Stoic may
preach in theory the paradox paria,
etc., as an answer to Horace’s view,
yet when we come to real life (ad
verum), he gets into trouble.

97. sensus, uurseelings,our sense
of right and wrong, almost ,equal
to “instincts’' or “conscience.'’—-
mores, habits, our customary mode
of life.— repugnant, rebel, or protest.

98. utilitas, utility (as a techni-
cal philosophical term), or seffi‘sh
advantage, i.e. the selfish interests
of mankind, from which, he goes
on to say, the ideas of right and
wrong have risen through the mak-
ing of laws to protect these interests,

99. cum prorepserunt, etc.:
the doctrine of the development of
society, in accordance generally
with the notions of the ancients as
to the origin of man, but espe-
cia& of the Epicurean school. Cf.
LucretiuS, V. 780 seq. The chief

point is, that the law of the strongest

alone obtained at the outset, though
the Stoic would perhaps not admit
that right did not exist because the
inhabitants of the earth were not
able or inclined to practise it. The
argument is, however, not the mere
setting of one dogma against anoth·
er, but an explanation of utilitas
iusti mater in accordance with
what was in the main the generally
received opinion.

100. mutum, dumb, speechless‚
and so unable to defend his rights
in any other way than by fighting.
- turpe, shapeless, unszghtly, in

accord with the Epicurean notion

of development from lower animals.
— glandem atque cubilia: i.e.
for food and lodging, to supply
their natural wants from Nature's
store in which there was as yet no
individual property.

101. unguibus.‚etc.: not having
learned to make better weapons. 3-
fustibus: one step in advance, at
least an acquired, not a natural,
weapon.— atque ita porro, etc-2
and so they went on, till experience
taught them the manufacture of
arms. But still there could be no
society and no rights until they
invented language, which made
association possible.

. 103. verba nominaque, words
⁷(to express ideas) and names (to
assign to things). —voces sensus-
que, almost equal to ideas and sen-
