64 HORATI SERMONES.

club was usually held in his right
hand (cf. Virg. Georg. IV. 110).

5. ruber: the god was regularly
painted red.

chrum: the word stabat would
seem to imply a real tomb, but as
sepulchrum is used of any burial
place, stabat goes with it naturally

6. harundo: tle. a reed waving in the sense of was.

in the wind and serving as a scare-
crow.

7. novis . . . hortis: Maecenas
had laid out a magnificent garden
on the Esquiline, on a spot occupied
from very ancient times as a burial
place. Tombs of very great antiq-
uity and also common burial places
have lately been excavated in that
region. This particular spot seems
to have been only a part of the burial
place, devoted to the poorer classes,

8. eiecta, hustled out .· simply
heightening the picture of the mis·
ery of the slaves, and not probably
referring to any special usage. The
body of a respectable person would

be elatum.
9. conservus: the slaves were

often united into societies for the
purposes of burial; and when they
were not, doubtless they took care
of the burial of their fellows. Many
tombstones are found erected by
fellow-slaves and fellow·freedmen.
—locabat: i.e. the know-slaves
paid the expenses of the burial, and
contracted with the regular under-

takrzlishoc: τῖε. the public lot de-
scribed in v. 12, but agreeing with
sepulchrum. - stabat sepul-

11. Pantolabo, etc. < Get-what-
you-can): one of Horace's favorite
side thrusts at two poor creatures
whom he despises. — scurrae:
many persons in antiquity literally
lived by their witS, getting invita-
tions to dinner in return for the
amusement they afforded, aeting
somewhat like the court fools of
later timeS. Naturally‚ being with·
out visible means of support, they
were despised by their more fortu-
nate patrous,

12. in fronte, i.e. on the street.

with the inscription to mark the
place and size of the lot. Such in·
scriptions are numerous. Eg.
