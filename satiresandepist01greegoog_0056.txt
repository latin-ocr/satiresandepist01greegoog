36 HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. Ι.

non, ut si solvas ‘ Postquam Discordia taetra 60
belli ferratos postis portasque refi‘egy'tss
invenias etiam disiecti membra poetae.
Hactenus haec: alias iustum sit necne poema,
nunc illud tantum quaeram, meritone tibi'sit

suspectum genus hoc scribendi.

Sulcius acer 65

ambulat et CapriuS‚ rauci male cumque libellis,

magnus uterque timor latronibus 3 at bene si quis

et vivat puris manibuS, contemnat utrumque,

Ut sis tu similis Caeli Birrique latronum,

non ego sum Capri neque Sulci: cur metuas me? 70
Nulla taberna meos habeat neque pila libellos,

quis manus insudet volgi Hermogenisque Tigelli:

nec recito cuiquam nisi amiciS, idque coactuS,

non ubivis coramve quibuslibet.
scripta foro recitent sunt multi, quique lavantes ε 75 .
suave locus voci resonat conclusus,

In medio qui

Inanis

hoc iuvat, haud illud quaerenti5‚ num sine sensu,

tempore num faciant alieno,

62. etiarn, still.

63. hactenus haec, so much for
that point. — iustum, properly, τῖε,
according to the rights and laws of

oetr .
p 64.ysuspectum‚ viewed with sus-
picion, an allusion to v. 24.

65. Sulcius, etc.: the idea is that
those informers who plied a trade
in bringing accusations are a terror
only to evil-doerS‚ and one would
expect the argument to continue:
if you are honest men, you have no
reason to sear me3 but instead of
that the poet turns sharply‚ and says
in v. 69, “Though you have all the
vices of the worst men, still you need
not sear me, for 1 am no informer.'’

66. ambulat, walks abroad. —
rauci, i.e. with pleading.—libellis,
their indictments.

‘ Laedere gaudeS‚’

71. nulla taberna, etc.: the dis-
tinction is that Horace does not
publish his strictures.—pila: the
manuscripts were hung or placed
out by the pillars to be inspected
by the passer-by, as in our second·
hand bookstoreS.

73. nec recito: i.e. he does not
eve'n read in public, but only for
the damusement os friends, when
urge .

75. recitent, etc.: others ate fond
of reading in public in the Forum
and at the public baths‚ because
they like to hear themselves in the
enclosed s ace, which gives a reso·
nance to tfieir elocution, regardless
of tact or time.

78. laedere gaudes: another
peractum-ade by llil? eqemies, that he
is m iclous in sa ires, m answer
