making himself a guest or sojourner,
not a permanent citizen, in what-
ever school he happens to find him·
self (Cic. Tusc. 1v. 47). — deferor:
the technical word for being driven
{c} porgt or to land. Cf. Cic. Acad.
1⁸2. nunc, etc.: in the regular
Horatian manner he gives an ex·
ample of his course of conduct.—
agilis: it was a special principle
of the StoicS, in opposition to the
Epicuream, to engage in active civil
life as members of the body politic.
Cf. Cic. de Off Ι. 7. 22, and de Fin.
III. 20. 67.-civilibus undis, the
tide of civil lise.
of Iliferfliteaeliighseseeazldlyotrlillyff gggloili?
-custos, a champion. — rigidus,
strici, in accordance with the un·
bending character of the Stoic doc·
trines. The whole means», “now
1 becmne a conscientious Stoic,”
gud sacrifice myself to my public
utieS.

18. Aristippi: tle. now 1 fall into
the opposite extreme of sels-indul-
gence, and endeavor to harmonize
philosophy and inclination. Aris-
tippus of Cyrene (380 B.c.) was the
most worldly of the followers of
Socrates, and originated the Hedo-
nic school, whose ethica] principles
were afterwards adopted by the
Epicuream. He is put here as the
opposite extreme from the Stoics,
inasmuch as he made the enjoyment
of the senses the summum bonum
or ultimate motive to action (⁴⁶ the

chief end of man '’).—-furtirn, im-
perceptibly. —· relabor: the passage
from the altruism of the Stoics to
the egotism of Aristippus is regarded
as a alling back.

19. et mihi res, etc.= this is
ξὲΡείῗθῖςᾶῗὴέἛὲἓοῑὲξὲὲῖἒ Εὲῖῑὶέἓ
is hampered by his duties (me
rebus subiungere) as much as the
thoughtless man by his desireS. But
the verse contains also a summary
of the’doctrine of Aristippus, whose
ξ’,ἶῗξῗὲρέξιιῖἒῖᾗ 1220&ss} {Viffiff‘z}
any desire or duty. Thus the poet
represents himself (probably with
truth) as insensibly relaxing his zeal
in the performance of civil dutieS,
and giving himself up to enjoy-
ment and sels-culture. Cf. Ep. 1. 16
and 17.

21. ut . . . videtur sic . . . flu-:
unte tle. as philosophy is my chief
concern, I am impatient of every·
thing that hinders me in the pursuit
of it. This is at the same time an
expression of unwillingness to be
diverted by poetry, and of discon-
tent at the obstacles to becoming a

real philosopher.-opus debenti· ,
