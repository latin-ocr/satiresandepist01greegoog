118 HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. 11.

Haec mihi Stertinius, sapientum octavus, amico
arma dedit, posthac ne compellaret inultus,

ἱ--ἐῇνἹζίΧεῑῑίῒ insanum quime, totidem audiet, atque

respicere ignoto discet pendentia tergos'

Hor. Stoice, post damnum sic vendas omnia pluris, 300
qua me stultitia, quoniam non est genus'unum,

insanire putas?

'Ego nam videor mihi sanus.

Dam. Quid? caput abscissum manibus cum portat Agave
gnati infeliciS, sibi tum furiosa videtur?

Horat. Stultum me fateor (liceat concedere veris), 305
atque etiam insanum 3 tantum hoc edissere, quo me
aegrotare putes animi vitio? Dam. Accipe: primum
aedificas, hoc est, longos imitariS, ab imo

ad summum totus moduli bipedalis; et idem

corpore maiorem rides Turbonis in armis 310
spiritum et incessum : qui ridiculus minus illo?

An quodcumque facit MaecenaS, te quoque verumuest,

296. amico, as a friend.

297. arma, weapons to defend
myself with, i.e. these preceptS. -—
compellaret, tle. called madman.

299. pendentia: alluding to the
fable of the two sacks, one contain-
ing the faults of others, and hanging
in front, the other containing one’s
own and hanging behind.

300. Stoice, etc.: to give a more
humorous close, and to include him·
sels in the persons satirized, Horace
appeals to the Stoic to give his
diagnosis.— sic: the regular for·
mula in adjurations3 so, as you
grant my request, i.e. on condition
that. Cf. “ So may each airy moon-
elf and fairy,'' etc. T. Moore. “Tell
me, kind seer.'' — pluris: i.e. than
before, so as to recover from his
embarrassments.

303. quid, etc.2 in answer to

Horace's statement, that he is not
conscious of any insanity, Dama·
zssaffssieasaessg 3531?ss 2535:
less on the stage (hence videtur),
implying that a raving maniae even
has no knowledge of his condition.

305. Horace jocosely assents ·to
the Stoic’s statement. — liceat: i.e.
let it be no shame to be convinced.

306. edissere, state fully, dis-
course at large.

307. aegrotaret in the Stoic
manner, as morbus and the like.

308. long0S, the great, but with
reference to Horace’s small stature.

309. idem, at the same time,·
showing his inconsistency.

310. torpore maiorem, toogreat
sor, etc.— Turbonis, a gladiator
of small size.

· 312. verum, right.
