HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 11.

impetrat et pacem et locupletem frugibus annum.-
Carmine di superi placantur, carmine Manes,

Agricolae prisci, fortes parvoque beati,
condita post frumenta, levantes tempore festo - 140
corpus et ipsum animum spe finis dura ferentem,
cum sociis operum, pueris et coniuge fida,
Tellurem porco, Silvanum lacte piabant,

3⁰23} Manes: i.e. Di Manes, the
elow.

139. agricolae prisci, etc.: the
mention of the employment of
poetry in sacred rituals affords a
natural transition to a description
of the rise of literature from festal
rites in Rome independent of Greek
influence, and the later fuller devel-
opment of literary taste and activity
under that influence, and further to
a statement of the present hin·
drances and discouragements with
which the poet has to contend.—
agricolae, etc.: Horace refers, no
doubt correctly, the origin of Latin
poetry, especially dramatic poetry, to
primitive harvest festivals, at which
songs were sung of a merry kind, ac·
companied with good-natured chaff-
ing and raillery.

141. spe finis, etc.: tle. as the
festivity marks the end of the year's
labor, so its expectation, confirmed
by the recurring festival, has sus-
tained the laborer through the year.

142. cum sociis operum: the
numerous allusions to the union of
slaves and freemen in these festivals,
make it almost necessary to take
sociis as referring to slaves, the two
groups being put together without
a connective; cf. od. III. 17. 163
Epod. 2. 65, and Marquardt, Privat-
leben, p. 172. Probably Horace’s
picture does not go very far back.

143. Tellurem porco, etc.: in
the general inosculation of all Ro·
man cults with each other, there is
no known festival that exactly cor·

responds to this description. After
harvest, on the 25th of August,
a sacrifice called Opeconsiva was “
made, and Ops can hardly be dis·
tinguished from Tellus, but details
of this sacrifice are wanting. Later ·
in the year, about Dec. 15, after the ·
sowing of the new crop, there was
a festival, the F etiae Sementivae;
later still came the Saturnalia, and
in January the Paganalia, a rustic
festival to Tellus and Ceres (hardly
distinguishable divinities); cf. Ov.
Fast. I. 663 seq. Horace may re-
fer to any of these, or his words
may be a confused allusion to all
of thern. —· porco: for some reason
or other the pig was the special

sacrifice to Ceres, and all other
Chthonic deities. Cf.

Placentur matres frugum, Tellusque Ceres·
Farr‘oiusfxo gravidae visceribusque suis.
—Ov. Fast. 1. 671.

It is to be noticed that tlus animal
especially belongs to settled life, and
so to the life of husbandry, as op·
posed to a nomadic life, in which
the herds accompanied their owners
in their wanderings. It formed also
the special food of the countryman
throughout Italy, the only animal
that was not too valuable to kill. 7-
Silvanum ε here as the god of pas-
turage, which was one of his prov·
inces, as opposed to agriculture
represented in Tellus. — lacte: cf.
silvicolam tepido lacte precare Pa-
len (another pastoral divinity), Ov.
Fast. IV. 746. —piabann appeared,
