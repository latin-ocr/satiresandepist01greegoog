HORATI SERMONES. 15

atque haec rara cadat dura inter saepe pericla. 40
Hic se praecipitem tecto dedit3 ille flagellis

ad mortem caesus ; fugiens hic decidit acrem
praedonum in turbam; dedit hic pro corpore nummos ;
hunc perminxerunt calones; quin etiam illud

accidit, ut quidam testes caudamque salacem 45

demeteret ferm.

‘ Iure,' omnes; Galba negabat.

Tutior at quanto merx est in classe secunda,
libertinarum dieo, Sallustius in quas ’κ Ι, ,

non minus insanit, quam qui moechatur⁴ At hic si,
qua reS, qua ratio suaderet quaque modeste 50
munifico esse licet, vellet bonus atque benignus

esse, daret quantum satis esset nec sibi damno

dedecorique foret.

Verum hoc se amplectitur un0,

hoc amat et laudat ‘ Matronam nullam ego tang0.'
Ut quondam MarsaeuS, amator Originis ille, 55

40'. rara: the pleasure is matred
and rare at that.

41. hic, etc.: describing the pe-
ric a.

46. iure ornnes, served him
rtssght, say all.—Ga1baz it is im-
plied that he was one of the suffer-
ers, who naturally can't see the jus-
tice of it. He is said by a scholiast
to have been a jurisconsult 3 and if
s0, negabat is equivalent to non
placuit, and refers in jest to his
professional opinion, as if he had
been formally consulted on the point.
— negabat, thought not.

47. secunda: equally removed
from the class of v. 30, and that of
v. 29.

48. Sallustius, etc.: but even in
this safer course there is a chance for
an excess, which is ruinous. Prob-
ably the person referred to is an
adopted son of the historian.

50. qua, as (really limiting‚ only
sofar as).—res, lzis interest, i.e.

his pecuniary condition, - ratic,
reason, good sense. — suaderet :
changed from suadeat, an apodo-
sis with omitted protasis (would
suggest), on account of the tense of
vellet; but as licet would be in
the indicative on account of the
meaning of the word (⁴⁴ verbs of
necessity, propriety‚’' etc.)‚ the
tense of vellet has no effect on
it.— modeste munifico: a kind
of oxymoron, lavish in moderation.

51. bonus atque benignus,
kindly and genereus. Notiee that
these words are much less strong
than munifico, which has an idea
of princeliness‚ but they represent
what the man means to be. In his
want of moderatiori, however, he
oversteps his mark.

53. hoc (abl.): i.e. matronam,
etc. Cf

“ Compound sor sins they are inclined to
By damning those they have no mind to.”

55. OriginiS‚ a famous mima.
