68 HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. Ι.

ΙΧ.

Ibam forte via Sacra, sicut meus est mOS,

nescio quid meditans nugarum, totus in illis:

accurrit quidam notus mihi nomine tantum,

arreptaque manu, ‘ Quid agis, dulcissime rerum ?’
‘suaviter, ut nunc est‚’ inquam, ‘et cupio omnia quae

viS.’

Cum adsectaretur‚ ‘ Numquid vis ? ' occupo,
‘ Noris nos ’ inquit ; ‘docti sumus)

SATIRE 9. This Satire, one of
the most famouS, treats of the efforts
of a pushing aspirant to social rec-
ognition to attach himself to Hor-
ace from ambitione motives. In a
society so aristocratic, and at the
same time so unstable, as was the
Roman at this period, social ambi-
tions must have had a very active
, stimulation. Horace's own rise in
life had been extraordinary, and
more vulgar aspirants and snobs
could not but attribute it to the
same selfish and pushing arts that
they were in the habit of using, and
endeavor to unite with him, and
get his support for their own ad-
vancement.

1. ibam: cf. 6. 112 and 122.—
via saera: the Boulevards of Rome,
the favorite lounging-place‚ along-
side the forum, and where the most
brilliant out-door life was carried
on.

2. nugarum: probably some ef-
fort in verse.

3. accurrit: his manner of ap-
proach already suggests his effusive-
ness.

4. arrepta: this action is also
excessive3 a simple salve would
have been enough. —quid agis·
the common very familiar saluta-

At ille 5

Hic ego ‘ Pluris

goes it?—dulcissime, etc„ my

dearest fillow,· still more familiar.
—rerurn ε partitive genitive (equiv-
alent to “in the world ''), but the
gender of the adjective is determined
by the sense. The best translation
is that given under the previous
word. -

5. suaviter, etc.: a polite but
distant reception of the salute ; es-
pecially is cupio, etc. (I wish you
every succesS, I'm sure) only an ex-
pression of thanks for his interest.
-ut nunc est, i.e. as the times go.

6. adsectaretur‚ followed me up, χ
as Horace proceeds on his way.—
numquid vis: the regular formula
of leave-taking, T here's nothing· J
can do jor you, is there?—occup0,
I anticipate him with.

7. notis nos, yes, make my ac-
quaintance. It was not uncom-
mon to reply to this formula in a x
sense contrary to its meaning, with
a kind of pleasantry, aS, iles, take
care of yourselfi· but here the snob
will not be turned off, and so rudely
tells the object of his addreSS. The
verb properly depends on vis. —
docti, an accomplislzed artist, i.e.
a trained literary man, and diner1

out, cf. v. 22. — pluria, etc.. like
0 indeed! I shall think more of

tion, like How are you? or How you, I’m sure, a cool reply.
