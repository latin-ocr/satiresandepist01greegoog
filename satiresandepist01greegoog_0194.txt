[Lm. 1.

quid Paris? Vt salvus regnet vivatque beatus 5 ιο

cogi posse negat.

Nestor componere litis

inter Peliden festinat et inter Atridenj

hunc amor, ir‘a quidem communiter urit utrumque.
Quicquid delirant regeS, plectuntur Achivi.

Seditione‚ dolis, scelere, atque libidine et ira, - 15
Iliacos intra muros peccatur et extra.

RursuS, quid virtus et quid sapientia possit,

utile proposuit nobis exemplar Vlixen3

qui, domitor Troiae, multorum providus urbes

et mores hominum inspexit, latumque per aequor, ,0
dum sibi, dum sociis reditum parat, aspera multa
pertulit, adversis rerum immersabilis undis,

Sirenum voces et Circae pocula nosti3

quae si cum sociis stultus cupidusque bibisset,

sub domina meretrice fuisset turpis et excors 25
vixisset canis immundus vel amica luto suS.

Nos numerus sumus et fruges consumere nati,

10. quid Paria: originally, no
doubt, agit or facit was to be sup-
plied, but the expression becomes
idiomatic, like “ How was it with
Paris?'’ or “But Paris?'’

11. componere, etc.= cf. Il. Ι.

Ξ3. hunc: better taken as refer·
ring to Agamemnon, as is Horace
were going to say illum ira, but
corrected it (as is indicated by qui·
dem) into utrumque. The love
os Agamemnon for Chryseis is the
original cause of the quarrel.

14. quidquid, etc.. i. e. there are
plenty os examples of the conse-
quences of folly to serve as 1333οιι3.

19. domitor. as called πτολί-
πορθος, since it was his craft and
not the prowess of emnon that
took the city. Cf. Odys. 1. 2, and
Cic. ad Fam. X. 13. - multorum.
with hominum. —- providus ε a

general representative os the epi·
thets τολῦμητις and πολύτροπος, but
expressing his character as well.

20. inspexit. referring to Odys.
Ι. 3, but here representing the hero
as improving his opportunities by
situdying human nature and institu-
t ons

21. dum. . Πρω-αι a common
form of translation of the Greek
participle. Cf. ἀρνύμενος, Odys. 1. 5.

2.,pertulit etc.· thus showing
the2 power of wisdom under the try-

23. Sitenum: Odys. XII. 39seqq.
—Circae: Onys. X. ι. 36 seq.

25. turpia, unshapely, as abeast.

26. canis. the dog was prover-
bial for uncleanness as the pig is
with us. Hence came part of the
reproach to the Cynic philosophy.

27. ιιο3, etc.= i.e. an example
that comes nearer home to us ι3
