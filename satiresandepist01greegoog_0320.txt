HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 11.

Omne supervacuum pleno de pectore manat.
Ficta voluptatis causa sint proxima veriS,
ne quodcumque velit poscat sibi fabula credi,

neu pransae Lamiae vivum puerum extrahat alvo,

Centuriae seniorum agitant expertia frugis3
celsi praetereunt austera poemata Ramnes:
omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci
lectorem delectando pariterque monendo.
Hic meret aera liber SosiiS, hic et mare transit 345
et longum noto scriptori prorogat aevum.
Sunt delicta tamen quibus ignovisse velimus,
Nam neque chorda sonum reddit, quem volt manus et

menS,

337. omne supervacuum, etc.:
i.e. as everything additional over·
flows after a vessel is full, so if pre-
cepts are too long, they “go in at
one ear and out at the other.''

338. ficta, etc.: in reference to
the delectare and iucunda. —-
proxima veris: an exhortation to
realism in art. ⁸
ιοέἶνῖιέξηῖἓέῗὲἔέἷὲἓῗῶζὶζὸιἳξζ
indulged—fabula, a play, which
Horace has always in mind through-
out, though not exclusively.

340. Lamiae, an ogress, a mon-
ster of Libya supposed to feed on
children, and used as a bugbear.
She was probably introduced onthe
stage in the Atellane farces, and
perhaps in this very situation. Cf.
Aristoph. Wasps‚ 1177. See Diod.
Sic. XX. 41.

341. centuriae seniorum, etc.:
a reason for combining the profita-
ble and pleasing. — seniorum, vet-
erans, in allusion to the divisions of
the Servian constitution, cf. 11. 1.
81, 85. — agitant: τῖε. reject, cf.
ῗὶξέῑ ὶι-αεοέἓεέεἷὲἒοξὲἒέηἱῗι itte· a Play

342. celsi, tim-spirited as dis-
daining instruction with the arro-
gant spirit of youth.—- austera:
tle. containing only instruction.—
Ramnes, young nobles, as bent on
pleasure only. The word is used
in allusion to the earliest equites,
who consisted of the juniors of the
first familieS. One branch of these
equites were Rhamnes. See Lange,
Iram. Altertlz.1. 353. Also Livy, Ι. 13.

343. omne, etc.: i.e. by combin-
ing the two excellences, an author
carries au the votes of both the par-
ties mentioned. — tulit: see Har·
pers’ Dictionary‚ s.v. ΙΙ. A. 4.—
punctum: cf. ΙΙ. 2. 99 and note.

345. meret, etc.= i.e. it sells well.
—- Sosiis: cf. I. 20. 2 and note.—
mare transit: cf. I. 20. 13, but here
the same idea has a different turn.

347. sunt delicta, etc.: as in
Horace's mind every rule of con-
duct has its opposite phase, so here
he warns against drawing the line
of propriety too closely. Vitiis
nemo sine nascitur, either in con-
duct or in art. Cf. Sat. Ι. 3. 68.

348. chorda, etc. ε afigure drawn
from the lyre.
