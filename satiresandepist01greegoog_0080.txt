60 HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. 1.

Pransus non avide, quantum interpellet inani

ventre diem durare, domesticus otior.

Haec est

vita solutorum misera ambitione gravique 3
his me consolor victurum suavius ac si 130
quaestor avus pater atque meus patruusque fuisset.

Proscripti Regis Rupili pus atque venenum
hybrida quo pacto sit Persius ultuS, opinor

omnibus et lippis notum et tonsoribus esse.
Persius hic permagna negotia dives habebat

ClazomeniS, etiam litis cum Rege molestaS,

parently without the use of the bat.
In this particular game three per-
sons threw to each other, but in
what the skill consisted is uncertain.
See Becker's Gallus Exc. 11.).-
{rabiosh etc.: put loosely for the
extreme heat of midday, though it
should mean the heat of the dog-
dayS, when the sun is in the Dog,
but there is Horace’s favorite con·
fusion of ideaS, between the mad
dog and the raging heat. Cf. Ep.
I. 10. 16, Od. 1. 17. 17.]

127. pransus, etc.: only a light
breakfast, at about tWO, to stay his
stomach till dinner‚ the hour of
which was rather late with him. Cf.
1 1 3. The dinner hour varied, as with
ηε, from say three o'clock till seven.

130. his: neuter, and depending
as an ablative of manner on victu-
rum.

131. quaestor: the lowest of the
offices is put for them all. His
reason for preferring the lowest is
not clear. Perhaps it is one of his
unexpected turns, coming in as a
jest upon himself, as it were.

SATIRE ⁷· This Satire contains
an account of a lawsuit before Bru-

5

tus when acting as governor of Asia.
Horace was probably present, and
gives this account among the other
trifles upon which he composed his
satires. The point of the whole is
in the pun in v. 35. The occurrence ·
was in 43 ΒΕ.

Praeneste (see v. 2 ), had served
under Varus„ an adherent of Pompey,
in Africa, and had been· proscribed
by Augustus.- pus atque vene-
num, gall and venem.

2. hybrida, hals-breed, son of a
Greek father and Roman mother. -

menae. See v. 5.

3. lippis, tonsoribus ε the physi-
cians’ booths and the barbers’ shops
were frequented by loungers as well
as customers, so that they were
favorite places for gossip. Cf. Ter.
Phormio 89, Plaut. Amph. 1013.
The disease of sore eyes was very
common at Rome, and was one that
had constant treatment. See Ῑ. 5.
