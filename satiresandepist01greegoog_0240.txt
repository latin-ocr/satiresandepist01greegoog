HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lis. 1.

XVII.

Quamvis, Scaeva, satis per te tibi consuliS, et scis

quo tandem pacto deceat maioribus uti,

disce docendus adhuc quae censet amiculuS, ut si
caecus iter monstrare velit; tamen adspice si quid

et nos quod cures proprium fecisse loquamur. 5
Si te grata quies et primam somnus in horam

delectat, si te pulvis strepitusque rotarum, '

si laedit caupona, Ferentinum ire iubebo,

Nam neque divitibus contingunt gaudia soliS,

nec vixit male qui natus moriensque fefellit.

Si prodesse tuis paulloque benignius ipsum

EPISTLE 17. In a social state
in which so much depended upon
patronage and favor as was the
case in Rome at all timeS, and espe-
cially aster the destruction of the
Republic, it was of the utmost im-
gortance for young men to know

ow to conduct themselves with the

’ great, so as to gain advancement in

life and at the same time preserve
their sels-respect. Both these objects
had been attained by Horace, and
'in this epistle he gives instructions
to a young friend on this subject
with his customary delicacy and
wisdom. Scaeva is otherwise un·
known.

“ 1. quamviS, etc.= a modest in-
troduction to avoid the appearance
of preaching in an arrogant tone.

2. quo tandem pactu, just how.
The direct question asked by the
intended in uirer would be, “ How
shall I eon uct mysels in consort-
ing with my superiors?'’ Hence
the emphatic tandem.

3. doeendus adhuct opposed
sharply to disce ; i.e. submit to leam
from one who has still much to learn
himself, at least his views, which

you may take οι· leave, as you feel
inclined. — amiculus, your humble
(i.e. modest) friend.

6. si te, etc.= i.e. in the first
place, it is not at all indispensable
to consort with the great, but a life
of obscurity, ease, and indepen-
dence has its attractions, as well as
a life of worldly success. — somnus ε
as opposed to the early rising neces-
sary for a client, who must make the
early salutatio.

one must live to attend upon the

eat.
εἳ8. cauponas i.e. the noisy tav-
erns full of brawling roisterers. -

10. fefellit: cf. λάθε βιώσας, the
maxim of EpicuruS.

11. si prodesse, ete.: i.e. if, on
the other hand, you wish to ’ help
your friends by your advancement,
and enjoy the luxuries that the rich
alone possess, then you must con·
sort with them, being yourself poor.
These two conditions are humor-
ously expressed by words which re-
lateh only to the foed enjoyed by
eac .
