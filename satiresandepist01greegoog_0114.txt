94 HORATI SERMONES'.

[Lm. 11.

cuius odorem olei nequeas perferre (licebit

ille repotia, natalis, aliosve dierum 60
festos albatus celebret), cornu ipse bilibri

caulibus instillat, veteris non parcus aceti.

quali igitur victu sapiens utetur, et horum

utrum imitabitur? Hac urget lupuS, hac canis, aiunt.
Mundus erit, qua non offendat sordibuS, atque 65

in neutram partem cultus miser.

Hic neque serviS,

Albuci senis exemplo, dum munia didit,

saevus erit, nec sic ut simplex Naevius unctam

convivis praebebit aquam : vitium hoc quoque magnum.
Accipe nunc victus tenuis quae quantaque secum 70

adferat.

59. licebit, although ,· a relic of

. .a more general use ⁴of licet, only

retained regularly in the present
tense.

60. repotia, the feast theaday
, after the wedding, at the house of
the bridegroom. The miser serves
no better fare than that mentioned,
·even on the highest festivals.—
natalis: the Romans made great
-account of birthdays.

61. albatus, in full dress, in
which the Romans appeared with
their togas cleansed and whitened.
-cornu . . . bilibri: opposed to the
more elegant gutta, which was
small, and served as a cruet, while
‘the miser has a huge horn contain-
ing his whole stock, as it were.—
ssipse: tle. he doles it out himself.

62. non parcus: he keeps his
1 wine till it sotira, and of course 1133
plenty of vinegar, the only thing of
¹ which he is liberal.

63. horum: the two extremes.
'The answer to the question is con·
tained in the following proverb: i.e.
neither, for both are equally bad,
there is danger on both sides. The
'true precept is given in v. 65.

In primis valeas bene: nam variae res

65. mundus erit (sc. sapiens) :
will be decent so far 33 not to give
offence by meannesS.

66. neutram ε neither too miserly
nor too luxuriouS.—cultus: geni-
tive of reference with misen cf.
cerebri felicem, 1. 9. 11. - miser,
pitiable, 33 he would be in case of
excess in either direction. —servis,
etc.: tle. in giving directions to his
slaves», he punishes them beforehand,
to guard against any carelessness on
their part, which is an indication of
excessive fastidiousness about his
table; whereas the other is so care-
less in this regard that he lets the
slaves give the guests dirty water.
The wise man will avoid both ex·
tremes.

68. simplex, good-naturai, easily
Mposed upon by his slaves.

69. vitium, etc.: this particular
matter, negligence in table service,
the poet gives as an example of the
other extreme. Then he changes
the subject entirely to the advan-
tages of a frugal life.
