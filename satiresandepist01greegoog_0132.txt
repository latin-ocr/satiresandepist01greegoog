HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. 11.

non ille aut Teucrum aut ipsum violavit Ulixen.'
‘ Verum eg0, ut haerentis adverso litore navis 205
eriperem, prudens placavi sanguine divos)

‘ Nempe tu0, furiose!

‘ Me0‚ sed non furiosuS.’

Qui* species-alias veris scelerisque tumultu

perr'nixtas capiet, commotus habebitur, atque

stultitiane erret nihilum distabit an ira. 210
Aiax immeritos cum occidit desipit agnos z

cum prudens scelus ob titulos admittis inanis,

stas anim0‚ et purum est vitio tibi, cum tumidum est, cor?
Si quis lectica nitidam gestare amet agnam,

huic vestem, ut gnatae, paret, ancillas paret, aurum, 215
Rufam aut Pusillam appellet, fortique marito

destinet uxorem, interdicto huic omne adimat ius
praetor, et ad sanos abeat tutela propinquos

tive on account of the comparative

tulos, leonors: strictly the inscrip-
tions containing the dignities at·

anist as having no real value to the
philosophie mind.

213. stas anim03 cf. commo-
tus, v. 209. -corz including the
intellectas well as the moral powers.
