14 HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. Ι.

inguen ad obscenum subductis usque facetus
Pastillos Rufillus olet, Gargonius hircum.

Sunt qui nolint tetigisse nisi illas,
, quarum subsuta talos tegat instita veste:
< contra alius nullam nisi olenti in fornice stantem. 30

Quidam notus homo cum exiret fornice ‘ Macte

virtute est0,' inquit sententia dia CatoniS.

‘ Nam simul ac venas inflavit taetra libid0,

huc iuvenes aequum est descendere, non alienas
permolere uxores! ‘ Nolim laudariser,’ inquit, 35

, ‘spic me’ mirator cunni Cupiennius albi. “
. Audire est operae pretium, procedere recte

qui moechos non vultiS‚ ut omni parte laborent ;

26. obscenum: translate as adv,‚
indecently,· properly, indecent, be-
cause not usually exposed—face-
tus, an exquisite. The word is
especially applied to persons who
are over-refined by intercourse with
society, in one age a dandy, in
another a dude.

27. pasti1108, lozenges, to per·
sume the person. As the ancients
were unacquainted with distillation,
persumes were conveyed in various
vehicles, especially in oils, or, as
here, in little cakes, — hircum, dirt
and sweat. The word is very often
used of the smell of the body in
confined places, like the armpits.
One of the extremes is over-care of
the body; the other, neglect of
simple cleanlinesS, of both of which
the poet complains.

28. nil medium est, there is no
middle course, a repetition iu other
words of the principal theme—sunt
qui, etc.: instances- of extremes in
another direction.—tetigisse: the
perf. inf. is apparently an archaic
construction, which survived especi-

’ - utque illis multo corrupta dolore voluptas

ally in conversational and legal
usage.

29. quarum: i.e. matrons, as ap·
pears from instita. — subsuta,
trailing: the instita was appar-
ently a flounce sewed on to the bot-
tom of the stola, or long tunic of
married women.

30. fornice: the arches of the
Circus Maximus were the special
abodes of people of the kind re-
ferred to ; cf. Ι. 6. 1 13. Hence the
name.

31. notus, of his acquaintance.

32. sententia dia, etc.: an imi·
tation of Lucilius (Valeri sententia
dia), and LucretiuS, 3. 3713 cf. ΙΙ. 0
1. 72. fix..

36. albix referring to women of
respectability, who are not obliged
to wear the dark·colored toga of the
prostitute.

37. audire est, etc.: imitated for
the comic effect from Ennius, who
uses this line in regard to the Roman
state, of course with vultis in the
affirmative.

39. corrupta, spoiled, marred.
