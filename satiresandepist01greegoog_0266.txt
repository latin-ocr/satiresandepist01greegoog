cuncti paene patreS, ea cum reprehendere coner,

quae gravis AesopuS, quae doctus Roscius egit;

vel quia nil rectum nisi quod placuit sibi ducunt,

vel quia turpe putant parere minoribus et quae

quod mecum ignorat, solus volt scire videri,

ingeniis non ille favet plauditque sepultis,

nostra sed impugnat, nos nostraque lividus odit.

to flowers on the stage3 but as a
scenic representation was always a
festival, such a scattering of flowers
is not improbable. — Attae: a
writer of plays, T. Quinctius Atta

authors. He seems to have died
B.C. 8.

(heavy) tr ag.edy — Aesopus. a
tragic actor, a friend of Cicero, and
the father of the spendthrift men·
tioned in Sat. II. 3. 239. Cf. Vidi
. . . in Aesopo familiari tuo tantum
ardorem voltuum atque motuum
ut eum vis quaedam abstraxisse a
sensu mentis videretur. Cic. de
Div. Ι. 37. 80.—Roscius: cf. Cic.
pro Arch. VIII. 17. Both these
actors had for some time been dead,
but could be remembered by the
older men.

83. nil rectum, etc.= i.e. because
they are so opinionated that they
make their own taste the criterion.

84. turpe putant, etc.· i. e. be·
cause they are too proud to admit
that their juniors ean be wiser than

they, or that anything new has been
learned since they were young.

86. iam Saliare, etc.: a still
more emphatic statement of the
same general idea. Such admirers
of antiquity wish to be thought the
only critics of sound taste, and
praise the ancients not from real
admiration for them, but from envi-
ous hatred of the moder-ns. —iam‚

Salios item Marti Gradivo (Numa)
legit . . . et per urbem ire canentes

hymns are here mentioned as a type
of the antiquity referred to. The
words must not be taken literally,
but only as a kind os reductio ad
absurdum of the principle of these
critics.

sal public to read, and wear out
by indiscriminate use. ——viritim:
used of anything which is done to
or by every man indiscriminately. —-
