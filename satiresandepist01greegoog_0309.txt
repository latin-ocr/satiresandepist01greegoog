HORATI EPISTVLAE. 287

digna geri promes in scaenam, multaque tolles
ex oculis quae mox narret facundia praesenS,
ne pueros coram populo Medea trucidet, 185
aut humana palam coquat exta nefarius AtreuS,
aut in avem Procne vertatur, Cadmus in anguem.
Quodcumque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi.-
Neve minor neu sit quinto productior actu
fabula, quae posci volt et spectata reponi. 190
Nec deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus
inciderit : nec quarta loqui persona laboret.
Actoris partes chorus officiumque virile
defendat, neu quid medios intercinat actus

184. praesens: i.e. of a person
on the stage, as opposed to the
action behind the scene.

185. puerOS, etc.: favor-ite sub·
jects for dramatic treatment, but in
which the action is too painful or
too reposterous to be represented.

1 8. odi: merely dislike: the
imagination refuses to credit the
acts when brought face to face with
them, and so we find them disagree-
able.

189. minor, etc. x a precept as to
the received length of a play. The
division of a play into acts seems to
have been the work of the Alexan-
drine criticS. It undoubtedly grew
out of the Prologue, three Episodes,
and Exodus of the Greek Play.

191. deus: in the Greek Tragedy
not infrequently supernatural per-
sonages were introduced. We may
suppose that this became more com-
mon, so that they were employed to
work the dinouement in cases where
it was unnecessary, in order to save
working out a plot by natural means.
Hence the dictum of Horace. Cf.
Eur. Andromache, v. 1227 seq. ,·
Soph. Electra, v. 1233. -— vindice,
such intersere-nce, properly, cham-
pion, one to whom a person has re-

course in time of trouble. Here the
difficulty in which the herois (no-
dus) must be one which seems nat-
urally to require divine interposition.
Cf. ut tragici poetae cum expli-
care argumenti exitum non potestis
(Stoic philosophers) confugitis ad
deum Cic. Ν. D. I. 20. 53.

192. quarta, etc.: the actors ap-
pear-ing on the Greek stage at one
time, originally only one, were grad-
ually increased to two (AEsehylus)
and three (Sophocles). If a fourth
appeared, he was almost always a
mere silent person. The Comedy
was a little less strict, but yet this
was the rule. ·

193. actori8,ete.: i.e. the chorus
should have a distinct character as
a group of persons with a definite
part in the action, and not be an
excrescence coming in to amuse the
audience between the acts, with
something unconnected with the
plot. Cf. the piper between the
first and second act of the Pseudolus
of Plautus. — officiumque virile,
its independent part (see above).
—chorusz for the presence of the
chorus on the Latin stage, see Rib-
beck, Ramische T ragiidie, p. 637.

194. defendat: cf. Sat.1. 10. 12.
