HORATI EPISTVLA E.

Lm. 11.

quod non proposito conducat et haereat apte. 195
Ille bonis faveatque et consilietur amice,

et regat iratos et amet peccare timentes ;

ille dapes laudet mensae brevis, ille salubrem

iustitiam legesque et apertis otia portis ;

ille tegat commissa, deosque precetur et oret 200
ut redeat miseriS, abeat fortuna superbiS.

Tibia non, ut nune, orichalco vincta, tubaeque

aemula, sed tenuis simplexque foramine pauco

adspirare et adesse choris erat utilis, atque

nondum spissa nimis complere sedilia flatu, 205
quo sane populus numerabiliS, utpote parvus

et frugi castusque verecundusque coibat.

Postquam coepit agros extendere victor et urbes

196. ille boniS, etc.: i.e. let the
chorus (as is usual in the Greek
Τ ragedy) be the spokesman of the
moral views and precepts of the
poet.

198. brevis: cf. 1. 14. 35.

200. tegat commissa: as the
chorus is present during the action,
it would be the depositary of secretS,
and by keeping them faithfully it
should enforce the duty of this form
of good saith. Cf. 1. 18. 383 Sat.
Ῑ. 3. 953 od. ΙΙΙ. 2. 25.

202. tibia, etc.: the poet in his
rambling way proceeds to give an
account of the development of the
musical part of the drama. — ori·
chalco vincta: the wood of the
tibia was reinforced with metal to
increase its resonance, but Horace
here evidently is thinking of the
double pipe and possibly only of
the binding of the two reeds. The
particular metal only indicates lux·
u .

ry203. tenuis: i.e. of feeble tone.
—simplexz i.e. not blown in pairs,
as it was later. —foramine pauco:
three or four holes only, from which

the ancient scales were made out
by the use of harmonics.

204. adspirare, etc„ accompany
and support. — utilis, suitable, im-
pliedly for the purpose mentioned,
and no other.

205. nondum spissa nimis: of
the small audience, the smaliness
pf which is explained by the next
me.

206. sane: this word in such
connections gives a light tone, like
our rather, pretty, not very (with
haud), and the like. —- numerabi-
lis: Ritter compares εὐαρίθμητος,
making this an example of the
choice of words mentioned in v. 53.
— parvusx indicating the reason
fot numerabilis.

207. frugi, etc.: the reason why
the people were contented with
the simple music; they were not
prone to luxurious gratification of
the senseS.

208. postquam, ete: i.e. when
the population became greater, and
at the same time luxury and wan·
tonness increased, the taste for

more complicated virtuoso music
