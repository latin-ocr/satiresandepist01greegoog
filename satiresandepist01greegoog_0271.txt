lit. made pina, a word which is ap-
plied to gods in their relation to
men, as well as vice versa ‚· cf. pia
mater, Ep. Ι. 18. 26 and note.

144. Genium: this word, from
the same root as gigne, expressed
to the Romans a very vague and ill·
defined conception, as were all their
religious coneeptions. It evidently
at first meant a divinity that pre-
sided over the birth of the individ-
ual. Cf. lectus genialis, Ep. Ι. 1. 87,
and Genium appellant Deum, qui
vim obtineret rerum omnium gene-
randarum, Paul. Diae. p. 71. This
divinity would seem to have been
supposed to be an attendant spirit,
and to fix in some manner the per-
son's destiny through life. (Cf. Ep.
ΙΙ. 2. 187.) Either originally or
later it was identified with the soul
of the person. (Cf. genio indul-
gere, genium curare, placare, and
od. ΙΙΙ. 17. 14.) Slaves were wont
to entreat their master by this gen-
ius, and it was especially worshipped
on birthdays. Here it is identified
with tgxe worshippers (hence mern-
orem .

Ι ¹45· Fescennina, etc.: the allu-

sion is to the Fescennine verseS, so
called from their origin in Fescen-
nium, a town of Etruria. The full·
est description of them is found
here. But there are many allusions
to them in other authors. Cf. Livy,
VII. 23 Sen. Medea, 107 and 112.
Tbey were in the chaffing, abusive
tone that the Italians seem to have
loved. They survived chiefly in wed-
ding ceremonies. .

151. intactis, ete.: cf. Sat. n.
1. 23.

152. lex: in the Twelve Tables.
This provision has not been pre·
served‚ except as quoted by St. Au·
gustine, but the verb used was occen-
tassit. Cf. Sat. ΙΙ. 1. 82. Another
provision which has been partially
preserved, qui malum carmen in·
cantassit, refers to incantations.

155. ad bene dicendum, etc.z
i.e. poetry was improved, and made
to praise and please. Horace may
have in his mind here the songs
sung in the triumphal processionS,
which were a curious mixture os
mocking and eulogy.

156. Graecia, etc.: Livius An-
dronicus, the earliest poet of Rome,
