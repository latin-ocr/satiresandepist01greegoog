HORATI EPISTVLAE. 175

Sperne voluptates ; nocet empta dolore voluptas, 55
Semper avarus eget ; certum voto pete finem.

Invidus alterius macrescit rebus opimis3

invidia Siculi non invenere tyranni

maius tormentum. Qui non moderabitur irae,

imperat3 hunc frenis, hunc tu compesce catena.
Fingit equum tenera docilem cervice magister

ire viam qua monstret eques ; venaticus ex quo

tempore cervinam pellem latravit in aula,

Nunc adbibe puro

pectore verba puer, nunc te melioribus offer.
Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem

so obedient, but in the mean time
the object compared has changed
in Horace's mind, and becomes not
the passions to be controlled, but
the boy himself who is to be trained
by himself while he is stin young
and docile.

66. cervinam pellem, etc.: it
would seem that dogs were taught

to hunt by showing them the hide
of a decr, and teaching them to
recognize that animal as the ob-
Ject of their pursuit. The moral is,
that men learn their habits while
young, and follow them ever after.

the lesson is given, as in a school,
before the real hunting in the for·
