HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[L113. Ι.

Exilis domus est ubi non et multa supersunt 45

et dominum fallunt et prosunt furibus!

Ergo

si res sola potest facere et servare beatum,
hoc primus repetas opuS, hoc postremus omittas.
Si fortunatum species et gratia praestat,

mercemur servum qui dictet nomina, laevum

qui fodicet latus et cogat trans pondera dextram

porrigere.

‘ Hic multum in Fabia valet, ille Velina,

cui libet hic fasces dabit, eripietque curule

cui volet importunus ebur.’

Frater, Pater adde 3
