HORATI SERMONES. 7

At bona pars hominum, decepta cupidine falso,
‘ Nil satis est,' inquit, ‘quia tanti quantum habeas sis.'
Quid facias illi? Iubeas miserum esse, libenter
quatenus id facit ; ut quidam memoratur Athenis
sordidus ac diveS, populi contemnere voces 65
sic solitus: ‘ Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo
ipse domi, simul ac nummos contemplor in arca.’
Tantalus a labris sitiens fugientia captat

Quid rides? Mutato nomine, de te
fabula narratur3 congestis undique saccis

indormis inhians, et tamquam parcere sacris
‘cogeris aut pictis tamquam gaudere tabellis

61. at: the Ms. authority is per·
haps in favor of ut, which would
introduce another‘ comparison like
ut in v. 54. The sense, however,
seems better with at, as if Horace
said, “ All this is true, yet men won't
act accordingly, but justify their
secking of gain, by v. 62, which
shows them to be incurable ”3 hence

afflrlvdquid facias, etc. — bona parS, the
' . bsst p‘fl't’ i.e. the greatest. — falso,

vam, 22: for which there is no real
good as its object.

62. tanti sis, you are ratecl at,
etc. The subjunctive is the regular
one of the second person with in-
definite subject. — quantum, what.

63. quid facias illi? what can
you dofor a man like that? i.e. one
who is determined to go on in this
way, as is indicated by nil satis est.
— miserum esse, enjoy Itis misem,-
but the expression has the idea of
an imprecation, like “go and be
hanged.'’ — libenter: i.e. with his
eyes open, knowing the true state
of the case.

64. quatenuS, here inasmuclz as
(which is an expression of the same
origin in English).—ut quidam,
etc.= implying that he must get his
consolation for his misery out of the

...κ

wretched pleasure of avarice, as
was the case with the Athenian.

65. contemnere, scorn, saying to
himself. —voces‚ cries, of the popu-
lace as they hooted after him.

66. at mihi plaudo: i.e. I take
my satisfaction for the bisses of the
people in my approval of myself.

68. Tantalus, etc.: Horace be-
gins as though he were going to
warn the miser by the story of Tan-
talus in the world below, in the
manner of a preacher of virtue, a
class of men not held in much re·
spect. See Sat. II. 3 and I. 1. 120.

69. quid rides: the miser, who
has no longer any belief in the
stories of HadeS, or any care for
this sort of preaching, laughs at
Horace’s attempt to convert him
with the sables of the world below.
But Horace turns upon him, and
shows that Tantalus' fate is not a
future terror, but his condition now.
He then proceeds to prove the
similarity of his condition with that
os TantaluS, in sight of good things
which he cannot enjoy.

71. inhians, gloating, i.e. with
his mouth open, staring at thern in
admiration, as if he would like to
eat them, and continuing his enjoy-
