HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 1.

nec socerum quaerit· quern versibus oblinat atris, 30
nec sponsae laqueum famoso carmine nectit.

Hunc ego non alio dictum prius ore Latinus

vulgavi fidicen ; iuvat immemorata ferentem*

ingenuis oculisque legi manibusque teneri.

Scire velis mea cur ingratus opuscula lector 35
laudet ametque domi, premat extra limen iniquus?

Non ego ’gentosae plebis suffragia venor

impensis cenarum et tritae munere vestis;

non eg0, nobilium scriptorum auditor et ultor,
grammaticas ambire tribus et pulpita dignor. 40

Hinc illae lacrimae.

scripta pudet recitare et nugis addere pondus ’

arrangement of ideas, but appar·
ently including course of treatment,
so that his poetry is not satirical.

30. nee socerum, etc.: τῖε. his
poetry is not abusive like that of
Archilochus. Cf. v. 25 and note. —
atris: as blackening the character.

31. famoso, abusive, as making
the person attacked famosus. Cf.
v. 25 and note.

32. Latinusz as opposed to the
Greek Alcaeus. Cf. Od. IV. 3. 23.

33. iuvat: i.e. 1 am proud to do
so. — immemorata, words before
unheard. Cf. ΙΙ. 2. 117.

Cf. v. 37, and also Sat. I. ιο. 81-87.

35. scire velis, etc.: tle. that

the crowd, nor to the pedantic critics.

37. ventosae, fickle, in matters
of art, just as in politicS, from which
last sphere the whole figure is drawn.

38. impensis, etc.: not literally‚
but continuing the figure of political
canvassing. These are the means

used by the political aspirant to
whom Horace compares himself.

39. nobilium scriptorum, etc.:
i.e. Horace does not seek the favor
of the lower orders of literary work·
ers, but hears only the works of the
great, and defends their genius. He
consorts only with the choice spirits
of the Augustan circle.

40. grammaticas, qfthe critics.
—ambire tribus: continuing the
figure—pulpita: the readers' desk,
which Horace does not frequent, as
do otherS, to recite his works. Cf.
Sat. Ι. 4. 73.

41. hine illae lacrimae: a pro·
verbial expression derived from Ter.
And. 126, for ‘f there's where the
trouble is.'' Α He means, it is be·

cause I refuse to recite my works, -

and submit them to the approval of
the crowd, that they disparage me.
—spissis indigna, etc.: the excuse
of Horace for not reciting.—thea·
tris: not necessarily the theatre
proper, though such recitations may
have taken place in these, but public
