HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 11.

quae canerent agerentque peruncti faecibus ora.

Post hunc, personae pallaeque repertor honestae,
Aeschylus et modicis instravit pulpita tignis

et docuit magnumque loqui nitique cothurn0. 280
Successit vetus his comoedia, non sine multa

laude, sed in vitium libertas excidit et vim .

dignam lege regi : lex est accepta chorusque

turpiter obticuit sublato iure nocendi.

Nil intentatum nostri liquere poetae; - 285
nec minimum meruere decus vestigia Graeca

ausi deserere et celebrare domestica facta,

vel qui praetextas vel qui docuere togatas.

Nec virtute foret clarisve potentius armis

quam lingua Latium, si non offenderet unum· 290

277. peruncti, etc. : doubtless sor
the same purpose as the later
masks, to prevent the recognition
of the identity os the actor from de-
stroying the illusion.

278. personae, etc.: AEschylus
was supposed to be the inventor of
the mask and other theatrical para-
phernalia. The earlier perform-
ance was doubtless a mere merry-
making, without special costume.
Cf. Καὶ Αἰσχύλος δὲ οὔ μόνον ἔξευρε
τὴν τῆς στολῆς εὐπρέπειαν, καὶ σεμ-
νότητα, ἣν ζηλώσαντες (ζηλώσας
ἦν) ἱεροφάνται καὶ δᾳδοῦχοι ἀμφιέν-
νυνται. Athenaeus 1. 21.

279. modicis: as in a small the·
atre. —pulpita ε i .e. the raised stage,
as opposed to the earlier θυμέλη, or
table of the single recitet. -tignisz
i.e. the first stage was a temporary
structure of wood. Cf. Miiller,
Bia‘hnenalterthie'mer, p. 128 seq.

280. magnum, etc.= i.e. he in·
troduced the dignity and solemnity
of Tragedy.

281. vetus: cf. Sat. 1. 4. 1.

282. libertas: cf. Sat. 1. 4. 5;
3. 52, note.

283. lex, etc.= i.e. the law was
passed and obeyed.

285. nil, etc.: a brief statement,
of the adoption of the Greek drama
by the Romam, and its attempted
development.

287. domestica facta: tle. the
choice of Roman subjects.

288. praetextas: i.e. plays an·
swering to Tragedy, as representing
the acts of consuls and the like,
clothed in the toga praetexta.
Titles preserved are Romulus (Nae-
vius), Sabinae (Ennius), Aeneadae
(Accius), and others—docuere:
the regular word sor producing a
play. -- togatas: plays on themes
from common lise (of persons clad
in the ordinary toga). They corre-
spond to the Greek Comedy as rep-
resented in the palliatae os Plautus
and Terence, but there are traces of
a choruS, or at least of a number of
persons speaking in concert. Titles
are Augur, Libertus, Psaltria, Sim·
ulans, Brundisinae.

290. si non offenderet, etc.= this
brings Horace to the kernel of the
whole, the want of care in writing
