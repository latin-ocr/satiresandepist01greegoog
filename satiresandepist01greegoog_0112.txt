Ieiunus raro stomachus volgaria temnit.

Ep. Ι. 1. 181. The sense then is:
“Allowing that you are deceived
by appearanceS, so that you prefer
(magis petere) this (bird or flesh)
rather than the other (the fowl),
yet how in the world can you tell
the difference in the case of the
lupus ?'' If we read hae magis
illa . . . te patet3 esto, we must take
illa as nominative (with earo un·
derstood), and hae agreeing with
carne; and take distat with magis
in the sense of the Greek διαφέρω,
be superior, “Though that flesh is

no whit superior to this, yet it is:

plain you are taken in by the differ-
ence of appearance,'' etc.

31. unde datum sentia, whence
is it given you to tell (by the taste),
i.e. how can you possibly tell where
the fish is caught— a thing which
epicutes make a great point of·-
whether in the Tiber or in the sea
outside? — lupus: probably either
bass or pike.

32. hiett change the construc-
tion in English3 whether the lupus
which yawns on the- platter was
caught, etc.

33. trilibrem: these are points

on which the epicures lay great
streSS, though they are really of no ’
account, as the poet shows.

35. quo pertinet ergo, what
point is there then in, etc.: ἐκ. if
you like a big mullet, why despise
a great lupus? The answet is, that
the epicure demands something
strange and unnatural. ‚

36. illis z the lupus, as being more
distant from the mind of the speaker.

38. raro: take with ieiunus.

interposed from a glutton, who cares
for quantity rather than quality;
“I wish 1 could see a big one,
etc.,'' as if he said, “ you can't have
them ton big for me.’' Thereupon
the poet bursts out into an indignant
exclamation directed both at the

41. quamquam: corrective;
though it is of no use to wish that,
for the food, however fresh, is as -
