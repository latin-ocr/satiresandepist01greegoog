HORATI SERMONES. 127

sive aliud privum dabitur tibi, devolet illuc

1 1. privum, rare, not possessed
by everybody. — devolet: chosen
on account of the thrush. ·

12. nitet, flourishes ,·, the figure
no doubt derived from animals and
lands which are well kept.

13. honores: cf. ruris honorum,
Carm. 1. 17. 16.

14. ante larem: the first fruits
were offered to the household god.

miseri lar-ihus consuevimus horti
’Μ Ρω“““’ Calp.Ec1. 11. ⁶4.

15. sine gente: a freedman, as
once having been a⁴ slave, and so
filius nullius.

'17. comes: one of the principal
functions of a humble dependent
was to escort his superior where·
ever he appeared abroad. Cf. Ι. 6.
101 and 112.—exterior‚ on the
left hand, where the more humble
companion would go. Cf. Suet.
Claud. 24; Eutrop.VII. 13 3 see also
tfigam latus,' meaning the same
t ing.

. 18. utne tegam, the idea os, etc.

— Damae ε a common slave’s name.
The little struggle of the hero gives
the more force to his very speedy
submission.

19. melioribus t dative, as in
Greek. — ergo pauper eris, then

you’ll bave to be, etc„ in a Laconic

style, showing the necessity of this
degradation. To which Ulysses re·
plies as it were, ‘⁴ Oh well, if Ι must,
Ι will.'’

20. fortem hoc, etc.: the point
of this lies in the fact that his other
sufferings had contained no abase·
ment, while here the degradation is
sels-imposed‚ though the words are
imitated from his expressions of
heroic fortitude. Cf. Odys. XX. 18,
and V. 224—hoc: of course the
degradation‚ not the poverty.

22. ssiam, dig up (like eruam),
as the earth is the source of the
precious metals. ,

23. dixi, etc.: with a little impa-
tience, as if he said, 1 told you be·
fore, that is the only way. Cf. the
abruptness of pauper eris.
