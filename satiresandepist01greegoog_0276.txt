HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. ΙΙ.

‘Dixit adhuc aliquid ?’ ‘ Nil sane.’ ‘ Quid placet ergo? ’
‘ Lana Tarentino violas imitata venen0.’

Ac ne forte putes me quae facere ipse recusem,

cum recte tractent alii, laudare maligne;

ille per extentum funem mihi posse videtur

210

ire poeta, meum qui pectus inaniter angit,

irritat, mulcet, falsis terroribus implet,

ut magus et modo me Thebis modo ponit Athenis,
Verum age, et his qui se lectori credere malunt

quam spectatoris fastidia ferre superbi 215

curam redde brevem, si munus Apolline dignum
vis complere libris et vatibus addere calcar,

ut studio maiore petant Helicona virentem.

207. lana, etc.: tle. the magnifi-
cent dress of the actor. The same
effect is often produced by the
modern actress' wardrobe.-Taren·
tino: cf. Nepos Cornelius qui divi
Augueti principatu obiit.- Me, in·
quit, iuvene violacea purpura vige·
bat, cuius libra denariis centum
venibat, nec multo post rubra Tar·
entina. Huic successit dibapha
Tyria, quaein libras denariis mille
non poterat emi. Plin. Nat. Hist.
IX. 39 (63). The ancient purpura,
made from the shellfish of the Medi·
terranean, had a very wide range,
including reds (on the crimson side)
almost to black, brownS‚ orangeS,
lilacS, mauveS, as well as what we
should now call purple, all the col-
ors seen in the modern pansy. —-
veneno, drag, perhaps a translation
os φάρμακον.

208. ae ne forte, etex i.e. for
sear you should think 1 damn with
faint praise the works of poets in a
line which I do not attempt myself,
and so you should distrust my opin-
ion on the state of the art, I assure
you that I think the dramatic art is
the most difficult, and merits the

highest praise when it is well done,
in that its effect is so powerful upon
the spectator.

209. maligne, grudginghe, mea-
gray, the opposite of benigne, gen·
erously,· cf. Oa'. I. 9. 6.

210. per extentum, etc.: appar-
ently proverbial sor difficulty.

212. irritat, etc.: by the vivid-
ness of dramatic presentation.

213. Thebis, Athenis: the usual
scenes os the heroic tragedy.

214. verum age, etc.: the poet
now turns from the stage to pub-
lished woxks. This is a branch
worthy of consideration if Augustus
wishes to encourage literature, so
as to fill the Palatine library with
worthy productions.

216. Apolline ε the Palatine
library was attached to the temple
os Apollo, dedicated to him as the
leader of the Muses. Cf. 1. 3. 17
and note. ⁸

217. addere calcar, to apply an
additional spur.

218. Helicona, etc.= tle. as the
seat of the MuseS‚ to which their

votas-ies would resort.
