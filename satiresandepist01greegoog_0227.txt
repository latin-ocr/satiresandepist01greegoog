fasciculum portes librorum ut rusticus agnum,

ut vinosa glomus furtivae Pyrria lanae,

ut curn pileolo soleas conviva tribulis, 15
Ne vulgo narres te sudavisse ferendo

carmina, quae possint oculos aurisque morari

Caesaris ; oratus multa prece, nitere porro.

Vade, vale; cave ne titubes mandataque frangas,

form of a command. ‘⁴ In this way,
namely‚ don’t carry, etc.'' — sub ala,
etc. ε the three ways of carrying the
packet under his arm, which he is to
avoid, are (a) the awkward vigor of
the rustic who fears his burden may
ff? 5122 ‘3325221-,0032223‘2555
and (c) the tight grip of the hum-
ble guest on his hat and sandaIS‚
who is dazed by the unaccustomed
splendor.

14. Pyrria: said to be a slave in
a comedy of Titinius.

15. pilleolo, soleas: the humble
guest, having no slave, would carry
his own out-door costume.

16. ne volgO, etc.: the messen-
ger is also warned against babbling
on the way and boasting os the
value and importance of his mis·
sion: Α

’ 18. oratus: i.e. with questions as
to his mission.

19. cave: retaining the short
final syllable of comedy, and doubt·
less also of conversation3 cf caune·
as (cave ne eas). — frangas: re·
turning to the play upon the name
of the messenger. As his wares

are not fragile, the meaning must ’
be general.

Ems'rme: 14. This epistle is in
form addressed to the poet’s stew-
ard, but is really a kind of apo-
logue of which the moral is an
exhortation to contentment and to
a life suited to one's nature. Itis
doubtless founded on some actual
complaints of the steward.

- 2. fastidis: probably on account

of its small proportions and its
dulness. —- habitatum: i.e. though
it is not so small, after all. - quin·
que socia, etc. : i.e. families, tenants
of the poet.

3. Variam: the market town of
the neighborhood. — dimittere:
probably to the meetings of the
pagani for civil or religious pur·
poses. Each pagus or territorial
division formed a commune with
corporate privileges and common
religious rites.

4. certemus, let us try, i.e. in a
kind of wager, to decide which of
us does his duty best in his domain,
Horace in sels-improvement, or the
steward in husbandry.
