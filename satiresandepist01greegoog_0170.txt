xHORA‘I'I SERMONES.

[Lm. II.

poscit te mulier, vexat foribusque repulsum 90
perfundit gelida, rursu-s vocat : eripe turpi

colla iug0. ‘ Liber, liber sum‚' dic age! Non quis ;
urget enim dominus mentem non leniS, et acris
subiectat lasso stimuIOS, versatque-negantem.

Vel cum Pausiaca torpeS, insane, tabella, 95
qui peccas minus atque eg0, cum Fulvi Rutubaeque

aut Pacideiani contento poplite miror·

proelia rubrica picta aut carbone, velut si

re vera pugnent, feriant, vitentque moventes

arma viri? Nequam et cessator Davus; at ipse 100
subtilis veterum iudex et callidus audis,

Nil ego, si ducor libo fumante: tibi ingens

tive by showing that Horace is the
slave of passion. The point is in
rursus vocat, wherein the lover is
assumed to be so vexed with his

mistress as to desire to break off the ι

connection, but is not sufficiently
master of himself to assert his free·
dom when she summons him again.

94. subiectat, etc.,plies the spur:
i.e. like spurs. —versatz the same
figure of a restive horse.

95. Pausiaca, os Pausias, a
painter of Sicyon, remarkable for
his skill in foreshortening. There
was a famous painting of his in the

dazea' before, indicating a craze for
painting (cf. Ep. 1. 6. 14, and stupet,
Sat. Ι. 4. 28). The point of the
reproach is that such a passion is
regarded by the Stoics as inconsist-
ent with the serious purpose of the
Sage (cf. Cic. Parad. 5. 2).—ta-
bella, a bit o a picture, with de·
preciation. f. the vivid descrip-
tion in v, 99.

96. peccas: i.e. when Davus
stops to look at the advertisements
of gladiatorial shows (cf. circus

posters) he is regarded (see v. 100)
as a worthless loiterer (cf. the mod·
ern errand boy), of course a slavish
vice3 why should not then Horace's
admiration in a similar case be re·
garded as a slavish fault. — Fulvi,
etc.: gladiators.

97. contento, etc„ standing on
tiptoe, as he looks at the pictureS.

98. rubrica: such posters were
drawn on the walls, Some are
found in Pompeii, scratched in the
plaster (cf. Plin. Ν. H. XXXV. 52).

99. vitent, pa‘rry, though the
corresponding process with the an·
cient3 was one of dodging (cf. elu-
dere .

100. Dama, sc. audit, from au·
dis, v. 101.

callidus, α connaisseur.— audis,
cf. ΙΙ. 6. 20.

102. nil: i.e. nequam, a good-
sor-nothing, referring to the slavery
of the appetite.--1ibo: such dain-
ties were apparently for sale in full
view on the street, as at chestnut
stands or fruit stalls. -tibi ingena,
etc.: ·i.e. “are not you equally

greedy ἓ ”
