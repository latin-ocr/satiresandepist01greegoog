HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 1.

neve putes alium sapiente bonoque beatum, ω
neu, si te populus sanum recteque valentem

dictitet, occultam febrem sub tempus edendi

dissimuleS, donec manibus tremor incidat unctis,
Stultorum incurata pudor malus ulcera celat.

Si quis bella tibi terra pugnata marique 25
dicat, et his verbis vacuas permulceat aures:

‘ Tene magis salvum populus velit an populum tu,

servet in ambiguo, qui consulit et tibi et urbi,

Iuppiter,’ Augusti laudes agnoscere possis:

cum pateris sapiens emendatusque vocari, 30
respondesne tu0, dic sodes, nomine? ‘Nempe

vir bonus et prudens dici delector ego ac tu.'·

Qui dedit hoc hodie, cra8‚ si volet, auferet, ut si ²

we need not conclude that the man
was really spoiled‚ but only that
Horace saw in him a tendency to
substitute reputation for character,
and made that fact a text for a
more general sermon.

20. alium sapiente: an exten-
sion of the construction of compara·
tives‚ probably imitated from the
Greek. Cf. Ep. ΙΙ. 1. 240, and
Cic. ad Fam. XI. 2.

21. neu si te, etc.: an illustra-
tion drawn from a man’s physical
condition. Here, as usual, the
simile is incorporated in the thought
itself.

22. sub tempus edendi: the
time when a sick man ought to
think of his condition and abstain.
Not doing this, he is attacked while
at the table.

24. stultorum: the emphatic
position gives it the force, “ It is
only fools who,” etc.— pudor ma·
lus: cf. Sat. Π. 3. 39.

²5· si quis bella, etc.: an ex-
ample of a tribute which Quinctius
would at once recognize as not justly
paid to him. Why not, then, recog·

nize any other undeserved compli-
ment as such?

26. vacuas, listening·‚ unoccu-
pied by anything else.

27. tene magis, etc.: this sounds
like a quotation, and is in fact said
by the scholiasts to be taken from
a ξῗπὲἓὲνῖἲηῗ wish that no cir·
cumstance may arise to decide the
question through any missortune
that may happen0to either:

33. qui dedit, etc.: i.e. butif the
praise is false, being only in repu-
tation, the people who give it can
take it away again with equally arbi·
trary caprice.
