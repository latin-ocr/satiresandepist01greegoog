13. Attica virgo: i.e. a Κανη-
φόρος (cf. Ι. 3. 10), indicating a
solemnity and dignity of demeanor
suited to his august mission.

14. Hydaspes: i.e. an East In-
dian, a rare luxury.

15. Caecuba: one of the finer
wineS, but not necessarily indicating
any vulgar display (cf. Od. 11. 14.
25).—Alcon: the mention of the
name seems to indicate another rare

slave, but whence brought is not “

known, perhaps frorn Greece. But
a Greek slave would be no rarity (cf.
Aleia, a German divinity). — Chi-
‘umz the Greek wines were milder
and sweeter than the Italian, and
thus formed a contrast and gave
variety. -- maris expete, without
sea-water, which was usually added
to all but the very best Greek wines,
as men drink Apollinaris with their
wine nowadays. In summa gloria

menio postquam parcius mari con·

There is not necessarily anything of
bad taste in the things served. The
host gives his guests a choice be·
tween the hot but rich Italian wines
and the sweet and mild but equally
choice Chiam serving the last in its
full strength and at the same time
without the tang which the sea-
water would have given it. If there

is anything wrong in the whole mat-
ter, it is only the overstrained and
anxious nicety of selection and ser-
vice.

16. Albanum, etc.: here is ap·
parently an overwrought anxiety to
please the distinguished guest, but
not necessarily intended as an os·
tentatious display, notwithstanding
Horace's exclamation. He may
merely mean that such resources
cause a host to worry over the
matter.

19. Fundani, cf. I. 10. 42.— ,
laboro nosse, Iam afving to know.

20. summus, etc.: the triclinium
was arranged round three sides of a
square, within which was the table,
and the guests reclined there on a
couch, thus:

1. Fundanius, 5. Vibidius,

2. ViscuS. 6. Maecenas,
3. Varius. 7. Nomentanus.
4. ServiliuS. 8. Host.

9. Porcius. (τ
