lucum ligna: cave ne portus occupet alter,

ne Cibyratica, ne Bithyna negotia perdas;

mille talenta rotundentur, totidem altera, porro et

tertia succedant, et quae pars quadret acervum. 35
Scilicet uxorem cum dote fidemque et amicos

et genus et formam regina Pecunia donat,

ac bene nummatum decorat Suadela Venusque.
Mancipiis locuples eget aeris Cappadocum rex.

Ne fueris hic tu.

Chlamydes LuculluS, ut aiunt, 20

si posset centum scaenae praebere rogatuS,
. ‘ Qui possum tot ? ’ ait,‘ Tamen et quaeram et quot habebo

, mittam.’

Post paullo scribit sibi milia quinque

esse domi chlamydum ; partem vel tolleret omnes.

other hand, you go to the other
extreme, and think that virtue is the
mere fustian of philosopherS, then
the natural conclusion is that you
should devote yourself to the objects
of human desire with insatiable
greed. This strenuousness he illus-
trates in detail in the following.—
et, and (as you naturally would).

32. lucum ligna: i.e. a sacred
grove is nothing but firewood, the
sanctity being a mere pretence or
notion. — portus occupet, gain tlte
barber be ore you, to get higher
prices for {is wares by bringing them
in early. Cf. the races os the first
tea-ships in our own times.

33. Cibyratica: from Cibyra, a
commercial city of Phrygia. The
whole region of the Black Sea and
of Asia Minor was the seat of the
most lucrative commerce of the
times. Here the capitalist or spec·
uiator is referred to, as the humbler
mercator is in the preceding.

35. quadrat: τῖε. makes it four
times as much, referring to rolling
up wealth in arithmetic rati0.

36. scilicet, sbr 0 course, an
ironical statement of t e advantages
of wealth as giving the sources of

happiness. — uxorem cum dote:
cf. Ῑ. 2. 44.—fidem, credit, both in
a business sense, and also almost
equivalent to auctoritas.

38. decorat: τ“.ε. each with her
own peculiar gift.-Suadela: the
goddess of persuasion or eloquence.
—Venus: as the goddess of grace
and favor.

39. mancipiis, etc.: i.e. don't
be satisfied with wealth in one direc-
tion; be not content even with
regal position without enormous
riches. — Cappadocum rex: the
allusion is doubtless to Ariobar-
zaneS, mentioned several times by
Cicero as in an embarrassed condi·
tion. Cf. ad Att. VI. 1. 3, and VI. 3. 5.
From Cappadocia came a favorite
breed of slaves. Cf. Plut. Luc. 39.

40. fueris: with long i, preserv-
ing the ancient quantity. — Lucul-
lus, etc.: be rather like Lucullus,
who didn’t know how much he did
have, as is illustrated by the anec-

. dote.

41. scaenae: i.e. for the stage
on some festive occasion. —roga·
tus: i.e. by. the aedile.

44. chlamydum ι with the an·
cients these were objects of wealth.
