191. di tibi dent, etc.= imitation
of Il. Ι. 18 ; a polite response to the
graciously given permission.

192. consulere, respondere:
technical words of submitting ques·
tions to* be decided by a juriscon-
sult. The latter word must refer to
the king, who is here the person
consulted. The attitude of a client
accords with the assumed humility
of the soldier playing Stoic.

187. Iinille: here treated as a
substantive, like milia. —insanus z
the main point in the whole. After
the award of the arms of Achilles to
Ulysses, Ajax went mad and slew a
flock of sheep, thinking them to be
the Greek heroes, in which delusion
consisted his insanity.

199. tu cum pro vitula, etc.=

the treating of Iphigenia as a vic-
tim, instead of a' heifer waS, the
soldier argues, no less a mark of
insanity than the delusion of Ajax.
200. improbe, unnatural father,

· or monster.— mola, a regular ac-

companiment of a sacrifice. Prob-
ably because meal and salt were the
necessaries of life.

201. rectum animi: i.e. rectum
animum, or rectum statum ani-
mi, as opposed to its overthrow
in insanity.— quorsum: sc. ten-

· dis, or haec pertinet, what do you

mean by that? what does that
prove ?— insanus: tle. when you
consider him insane, or regard these
as marks of his insanity. —quid
enim, why Ι what, etc. ; where
enim is explanatory of the implied
statement that Agamemnon is him-
self insane.

202. abstinuit vim, he kept his
violent hands.

203. mala multa: angry words
were not considered proof of mad-
ness (cf. v. 140).
