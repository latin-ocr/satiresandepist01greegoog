HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 1.

’ evellas agm, et melior sit Horatius an res. 5
Me quamvis Lamiae pietas et cura moratur,

fratrem maerentis, rapto de fratre dolentis

insolabiliter, tamen istuc mens animusque

fert et amat spatiis obstantia rumpere claustra.

Rure ego viventem, tu dicis in urbe beatum ;

10

cui placet alteriuS, sua nimirum est odio sors,

Stultus uterque locum immeritum causatur inique;

in culpa est animuS, qui se non effugit unquam.

Tu mediastinus tacita prece rura petebas,

nunc urbem et ludos et balnea vilicus optas; 15
me constare mihi scis et discedere tristem,
quandocumque trahunt invisa negotia Romam.

Non eadem miramur; eo disconvenit inter

5. τρες i.e. the farm.

6. me, etc.: a confession of the
poet's own weakness‚ opposed to
the tu in v, 14. At the same time
Horace justifies himself as consistent
in his desire for a quiet life in the
country ; esar. 16.-—quamvis, etc.:
i.e. though I am detained iu the
city, yet my heart is there in the
country. —Lamiae ς possessive gen-
itive.—pietas: the fraternal affec·
tion which causes Lamia to mourn
for his brother. -— cura: i.e. his
trouble or sorrow. — moratur: on
account of Horace’s duty to console
him. The person referred to is the
same friend of the poet, L. Ailius
Lamia, mentioned in Od. Ι. 26 and
addressed in 111. 17.

7. maerentis: of external mouru-
ing. —- dolentis: of inward sorrow.
Cf. Cic. ad Att. XII. 28 maerorem
minui, dolorem nec potui nec si
possem vellem.

8. mens animusque, my mind
· and heart, thoughts and desires.

9. amat, longs‚· cf. Od. 111. 9.
24. — spatiis, the open field, prop-
erly the tace course, shut off by the

barriers (claustra) in front of the
ccy‘ceres, or stalls in which the horses
were confined till the word was
given. - obstantia, which bar, by
a change of point of view govern-
ing spatiis, instead of that which
is really barred.

12. causatur, finds fault with,-
properly, assigns as the cause.

14. tu, etc.: i.e. you also are
discontented‚ and with less consis-
tency than I, for you were equally
unsatisfied in the city. — rnedi-
astinuS, a man os all work, in
the city house. — tacita: εῖτ. you
looked upon it as such a boon that
yfu (hardly dated express the wish
a ou .

1 .- ludos et balnea: delights
of e city.

16. me, etc. ς but I am consistent
with myself.

18. non eadem, εἴας i-e. while
Ῑ should be glad to be always in the
country, you are dissatisfied as soon
as you get there; and the cause of
this difference is that we have differ-
ent views of the leasures of life.
You have no care or rural beauties,
