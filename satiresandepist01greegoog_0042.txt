22 HORATI SERMONES.

mane, diem totum stertebat.

[Lm. 1.

Nil fuit umquam

sic impar sibi. —- Nunc aliquis dicat mihi: ‘ Quid tu
nullane habes vitia?' Immo alia et fortasse minora. ’ 20
Maenius absentem Novium cum carperet, ‘ Heus tu,'
quidam ait, ‘ignoras te, an ut ignotum dare nobis

verba putas ? '

‘ Egomet mi ignos00,' Maenius inquit.

Stultus et improbus hic amor est, dignusque notari.
Cum tua pervideas oculis mala lippus inunctis, 25

construction is similar to the gene·
ral condition. In present time it
would be, “ Give him a million; in
ten days there is nothing,” etc., as
a general character of the man.—
noctis vigilabat, he would watch
the night through.

18. nil, no one. The use of the
neuter in this way is very common
tgl make the statement more univer·
s .

19. impar, inconsistent. —nunc
aliquis, etc.. here the poet turns
to the proper subJect of the satire,
representing some person who
hears him as becoming indignant
at this abuse os Tigellius, and ask-
ing is he himself is free from faults,
that he is thus severe upon another.
He thus shows that his abuse is an
example os what he satirizes. —
quid tu: sc. agis3 but the expres-
sion has become idiomatic, and the
verb is lost sight of. Trans. How
about yourself. θ

2ο. immo alia, oh, no (Ι do not
say that), but d fferent ones. -—- et
fortasse minora. best assigned
with the two preceding words to
Horace, though by some they are
given to the interlocutor-

21. Maenius, etc.· Horace, as
usual, illustrates his meaning by an
Jxample. — heus tu, look here, my

riend

22. quidam, one, some one, a
man. Cf. aliquis, v. 19. The

difference is that in the former no
definite person is conceived of,
while here a particular person is
meant, though not described or
identified. — ut ignotum (sc. te),
as a stranger to us, or as if we didn’ t
know you, i. e. “I's it ignorance os
your own character, or the hope of
deceiving us, that l’eads you to at·
tack another man’s faults, when
you have so many of your own?”
— dare verba, deceive, impose
upon, a common colloquial expres·
sion.

23. egomet, etc.. the naive an·
swer of Maenius shows the disposi-
tion which Horace is attacking, and
serves as a text for the following.—
improbus, conscienceless.

24. amor, sels-love.— notari, to be
censured. The construction is poetic
or colloquial, for which Ciceronian
prose would require ut or qui
with the subjunctive. The meaning
of the word comes from the mark
(nota) which the censor in making
up the rolls affixed to the name of
any person whom he wished to
remove from his position for mis·
conduct.

25. lippus inunctis, with your
blear eyes daubed wit’k eye-salve.
One is tempted to make' ιιι negative
in inunctis, as is the man had weak
eyes and did not care to put on the
usual remedy. But there seems to
be no authority for this.
