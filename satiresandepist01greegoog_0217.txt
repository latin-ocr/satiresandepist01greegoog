praeceptum auriculis hoc instillare memento:
‘ut tu fortunam, sic nos te, Celse, feremuS.'

IX.

SeptimiuS, Claudi, nimirum intellegit unuS,

quanti me facias : nam curn rogat et prece cogit,
scilicet ut tibi se laudare et tradere coner,

dignum mente domoque legentis honesta Neronis;
munere curn fungi propioris censet amici, 5
quid possim videt ac novit me valdius ipso,

Multa quidem dixi, cur excusatus abirem3

sed timui, mea ne finxisse minora putarer, .
dissimulator opis propriae, mihi commodus uni.

Sic ego maioris fugiens opprobria culpae 10

frontis ad urbanae descendi praemia.

Quodsi .

depositum laudas ob amici iussa pudorem,
scribe tui gregis hunc et fortem crede bonumque.

17. fortunam: here of good for·
tune, in reference to his accepta-
bility to his patron and his com-
panions.

EPISTLE 9. A letter of recom- ⁷

mendation of a friend Septimius, to

Tiberius, such as were very common

Jmongnthe RgllpaanOEef Cic. acl
am. . 143 ιη. ,4 .

4. legentis, selecting.—honesta,
'honorable friends, but made more
general by the use of the neuter.

5. munere, etc.: the poet while
asking what can properly be asked
only by an intimate friend, delicately
waives any claim of such intimacy.
The tone certainly implies a want
of confidence in the generosity of
Tiberius. One can hardly imagine

a lgaecenas addressed with such
cau on.

8. finxisse, etc.: πλε. he feared
he should be charged witha refusing
because he wanted all the good
things himself, and to have made
an excuse of his want of intimacy.

9. dissimulator, disparaging. -
commodus, ete.: i.e. using his in-
fluence in his own behalf alone.

11. frontis cf the slang“cheek.''
—urbanae, os tlze astute man of
the world (who is free from the
modesty of the simple countryman).
— descendi, have descended, as one

may be said to descend when having ’

recourse to a less worthy action. —
praemia, privileges, that which the
impudence of the man of the world
allows him to seek to gain.

13. gregis: i.e. cohortis arnico-
rum. The construction is that of
the predicate genitive. — fortem
bonumque: cf. Sat. II. 5. 64 and
note3 and Od. IV. 4. 29.
