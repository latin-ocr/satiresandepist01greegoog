80 HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. Ι.

versiculos natura magis factos et euntis

molliUS, ac si quis, pedibus quid claudere §93le

hoc tantum contentuS, amet scripsisse ducentos 60
ante cibum versus, totidem cenatus; Etrusci

quale fuit Cassi rapido ferventius amni

ingenium, capsis quem fama est esse librisque

ambustum propriis,

Fuerit Lucilius, inquam,

comis et urbanus, fuerit limatior idem 65
quam rudis et Graecis intacti carminis auctor, -
quamque poetarum seniorum turba; sed ille,

si foret hoc nostrum fato dilatus in aevum, ‚ ·

detereret sibi multa, recideret omne quod ultra

rum: the character of his subjects.

— dura, rough and stiff, not flexible

so as to yield to theg elegances of
oetry.

p 58. versieu103‚ etc.: i.e. smooth
and flowing, and carefully finished
verse.

59. ac, etc.= than would natu-
rally be the case with one that wrote
as he did, carelessly and copiously,
in the manner of his age. — pedi-
bus senis, i.e.hexameters.— clau-
dere, compost, an almost technical
expression for writing poetry, round·
ing off the lines.

60. hoc: i.e. merely making
verse without regard to polish.

61. Etrusci: so called, probably,
to distinguish him from the Cassius
in Ep. 1. 4. 3.

62. Cassi, an unknown poet.—
ferventius, rolling on more swistly.

63. capsiS, etc.: i.e. he mote
enough to make his own funeral
pile of his manuscripts and their
cases—capsis: these were cases
for rolls in which they stood up on
end.

64. fuerit: a concession, to which
is opposed the sentence with sed
ille, v, 67.

65. limatior, more polis-hed.—

idem, at the same time, a still
greater concession.

66. quam, etc.: i.·e. than the in·
ventor of this kind of composition=
could be expected to be.— rudia,
untried (with carminis). Satire
was probably not in fact a really
new form of literary art, but the
Greeks had not brought it to per·
fection as they had other formS, and
hence Lucilius had strictly no one to
imitate ; therefore the first attempts
must necessarily be rough. — in-
tacti: the Romans of Horace's
time considered satire as entirely of
Roman origin, which in some sense
it was. Cf. Quintil. X. 1. 93.

67. illef emphatic3 evenhewould
write with much more care and pains
if he were alive now3 an argument,
of course, in favor of Horace’s criti-
cism, as well as for his style.

68. dilatus: another reading,
dilapsus, gives no sense, and de·-
lapsus seems forced.

69. detereret, smooth away ,· re·
ferring to the use of the file, cf.
limatior.— recideret, prune away,-
not merely polishing, as in detere-
ret, but suppressing.— ultra perfec·
tum traheretur: i.e. overdone‚ be·
yond the golden mean of perfection.
