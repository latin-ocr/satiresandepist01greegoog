HORATI SERMONES. ⁸ 57

sic me defendam. Longe mea discrepat istis

et vox et ratio: nam si natura iuberet

a certis annis aevum remeare peractum,

atque alios legere ad fastum quoscumque parentes 95
optaret sibi quisque, meis contentuS‚ honestos

fascibus et sellis nollem mihi sumere, demens

iudicio volgi, sanus fortasse tu0, quod

nollem onus haud umquam solitus portare molestum.
Nam mihi continuo maior quaerenda foret res, 100
atque salutandi plures 3 ducendus et unus

et comes alter, uti ne solus rusve peregreve

exirem ; plures calones atque caballi

pascendi, ducenda petorrita.

Nunc mihi curto

ire licet mulo vel si libet usque Tarentum, 105
mantica cui lumbos onere ulceret atque eques armos :

92. istis: masc. and dative.

93. ratio, way os thinking.— si
iuberet: i.e. if it were the course
of nature that a man after a certain
age might choose his own father
and expunge his previous life, Hor·
ace says he would not change.

94. aevum: acc. after remeare,
like navigare mare, and the like.

95. ad fastum, to suit his pride.

97. fascibus (the means of hon-
estos), namely, curule officeS, of
which the lictor's rods and the cu-
rule chair were the symbols

98. tuo: Maecenas had himself
refused to be advanced in official
station, no doubt for the reason
Horace assignat, his dislike to the
burdensome state and social dutiae

- required of the great.

100. res: a larger property would
be necessary to support the dignity
of his position.

101. salutandi: the salutatio, or
morning visit of humbler persons
to the great, was a prominent fea-
ture in Roman social life. — dueen-

dus: such persons had to take with
thern a retinue of companions,.like
princes in modern times.

102. uti ne: apparently an ex-
pression more common in early
Latin in purpose clauses, not differ-
ent essentially from ne. sse clause
is here treated as a purpose, but in
English we may translate so as not
to, etc., or so that I could not, etc.

103. calones, etc.: all these
would be necessary for the proper
state of such a person.

104. pascendi, must be kept.—
dueenda‚ taken in my train. -pe-
torrita (a Gallie word), a four-
wheeled travelling carriage, the ex·
act form of which is not known,
but it must have been more bulky
and roomy than other fortnS. -
nunc, etc. (cf. v. 87): the advan-
tages of his present humble position.
— curto, sorry, little, only referring
to the size as suited to his dignity.

105. Tarentum: i.e. the whole
length and breadth of Italy.

106. mantica: i.e. with no train
