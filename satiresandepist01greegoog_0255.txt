quod timui mutare modos et carminis artem,

temperat Archilochi Musam pede mascula SapphO,
temperat Alcaeus, sed rebus et ordine dispar,

18. pallerem, ete: τῖε. this ten-
dency proceeds so far that men will
imitate the accidents of the moment
ges. casu).-exsangue: as pro-

ucing that effect.

19. Ο imitatores, etc.: here the
poet fully unmasks his battery, and
tells plainly what he has been
driving at. ·

20. tumultus, worrying and
sussing, as opposed to the steady
pursuit of some definite object.

21. libera: opposed to servum.
Horace here begins to distinguish
his own action from that of the imi-
tators, in that he has followed worthy
examples, to be sure, but in an in-
dependent spirit, and with such
changes as, confident in his own
powers, he had thought best to
make, acting therein in the same
manner as his great predecessors. —
per vacuum, through an unoccu-
pied field, as the Epodes certainly
were. — posui vestigia, I have
traced a course. — princeps, a
pioneer. ·

22. non aliena, etc., I have not
placed my fiet in another’s track.

— agentia, which pursued. — Ly·
cumben: one of the objects of the
elder poet‘s satire. This person,
having refused Archilochus as a
son-in-law, was attacked by him
with such virulence that he is said

to have hanged e]·self along with ”

his daughter Neo ule.

26. ac ne me, etc.: he here jus-
tifies the imitation that he has
allowed himself, by the examples of
Sappho and Alcaeus, who did the
same. —- foliis brevioribus, scantier
laurels.

27. timui, have not venturedae-
modos, the measures, i.e. the mette.
—- carminis artem, the structure of
the song, i.e. the form of the strophe.
