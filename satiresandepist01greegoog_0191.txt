HORATI EPISTVLA E. . 169

si dixit diveS, lacus et mare sentit amorem
festinantis eri; cui si vitiosa libido 85
fecerit auspicium, ‘ Cras ferramenta Teanum

tolletis, fabri.'

Lectus genialis in aula est :

nil ait esse prius, melius nil caelibe vita:
si non est, iurat bene solis esse maritis,
Quo teneam voltus mutantem Protea nodo? 90

Quid pauper?

Ride: mutat cenacula, lectOS,

balnea, tonsoreS,-conducto navigio aeque
nauseat ac locuples quem ducit priva triremis
Si curatus inaequali tonsore capillos

rides: quid, mea cum pugnat sententia secum,
quod petiit spernit, repetit quod nuper omisit,

94. si curatus, etc.: to show the
universality of this want of settled
