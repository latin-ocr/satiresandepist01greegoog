HORATI SERMONES. 23

cur in amicorum vitiis tam cernis acutum

quam aut aquila aut serpens Epidaurius ? At tibi contra
evenit, inquirant vitia ut tua rursus et illi.

Iracundior est paulo, minus aptus acutis

naribus horum hominum ; rideri possit e0, quod 30
rusticius tonso toga defluit, et male laxus

in pede calceus haeret ε at est bonuS, ut melior vir

non alius quisquam, at tibi amicus‚'at ingenium ingens

inculto latet hoc sub corpore.

Denique te ipsum

concute, num qua tibi vitiorum inseverit olim 35
natura, aut etiam consuetudo mala; namque

27· Epidaurius:
was a special symbol os the worship
of AEsculapius‚ and was often iden·
tified with the god himself. 1t was
in this form that the god was sup-
posed to have come from Epidaurus
to Rome, where a temple was built
to him on the island in the Tiber.
The serpent was famous for keen
vision (cf. the name δράκων), and
was supposed to possess prophetie
powers. The connection here is
probably only from Horace's favor-
ite way of giving an individual in-
stead of a class, and there is no
special reference to this particular
AEsculapius serpent.

28. rursus et illi, they too in
turn, i.e. those you criticise.

29. iracundior, quick-tempered,
an example of a case where injustice
is done by this criticism, inasmuch
as the subJect of it cannot, like most
men, disregard it, but is angered by
it.-— minus aptus: i.e. he has
a quick temper impatient of criti-
cism. -— acutis naribus, the keen
criticism, the figure derived from
the natural turning up of the nose
in fastidious disgust. (Cf. I. 4. 8,
and Ι. 6. 5.)

30. horum, os our day, when
this fault is so common.

the serpent

31. rusticius tonso: with his
hair in rustic style. — toga: the
Romans paid the utmost attention
to the set of the toga, plaiting it in
folds which were secured in a fixed
position. This requirement of fash·
ion the man neglects, letting his
toga fall loosely and awry.-male
laxus, loose and ill-fitting. d(

3²· at est bonu8‚ etc.: tle. e
has all these good qualities, which
are lost sight of in this over-fastidi-
ous criticism.

34. denique, etc-..3 i.e. in short,
learn tolerance of such minor faults
by sels-examination, through which
you will very likely find that you
have some as well.

of the ancients for purposes of
search. We should say search your
pockets or the like. — olim, at
any time.—inseverit: by chang-
ing the voice the order of words and
ideas may be kept in English.

36. namque: introducing the
reason for saying consuetudo as
well as natura. Even if one is free
from bad habits by nature, it may
happen that they have grown up
unawares, like wceds in neglected
ground.
