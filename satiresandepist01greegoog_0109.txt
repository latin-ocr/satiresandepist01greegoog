Quicquid sum eg0, quamvis

infra Lucili censum ingeniumque, tamen me 75
cum magnis vixisse invita fatebitur usque

invidia, et, fragili quaerens illidere dentem,

offendet solid0, — nisi quid tu, docte Trebati,

dissentis. T rebat. Equidem nihil hinc diffindere possum.
Sed tamen ut monitus caveaS, ne forte negoti 80
ineutiat tibi quid sanctarum inscitia legum: '

si mala condiderit in quem quis carmina, ius est
iudiciumque. Horat. Est0, si quis mala 3 sed bona si quis
iudice condiderit laudatus Caesare? si quis

opprobriis dignum latraverit, integer ipse? 85
T rebat. Solventur risu tabulae, tu missus abibis.
