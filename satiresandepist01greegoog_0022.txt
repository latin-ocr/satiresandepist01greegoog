2 HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. Ι.

‘ O fortunati mercatores l ’ gravis annis

miles ait, multo iam fractus membra labore. 5
Contra mercator, navem iactantibus AustriS‚

‘ Militia est potior. Quid enim? Concurritur; horae
momento cita mors venit aut victoria laeta.’

Agricolam laudat iuris legumque perituS,

sub galli cantum consultor ubi ostia pulsat. 10
Ille, datis vadibus qui rure extractus in urbem est,

solos felices viventis clamat in urbe.

4. Ο fortunati, etc.: in accord-
ance with the dramatic form which
satire takes (perhaps on account
of its origin, see Introduction),
Horace gives the direct words of
the persons referred t0.— fortuna·
ti: as getting wealth without the
toils to which the soldier is ex·
posed.—- gravis annis, tle. he is
getting old, but is not rich yet,
while the toils are more grievous to
him. Another reading, armiS, is
possible, but not so good.

5. fractus, skattered. -— mem·
‘ bra, frame. — labore: the battles
of the Romans were won by the
spade even more than by the
sword‚ and in full marching order
the soldier carried a weight of from
forty to sixty pounds.

6. mercator: it must be remem-
bered that the mercator is a trader
who sails with his wares in his own
ship; hence iactantibus austriS.
—austrisz the south wind is an
especially squally and rainy wind
in the Mediterranean. Cf. Il. II.
1453 Hor. Od. 1. 7. 16. The word
may be translated souwesters, or
southerly gales.

7. potior: it is the long and
tedious suffering that affects the
trader, and he contrasts with it the
short and sudden danger of battle.
— quid enim, qs· course (lit. why?
in fact). Cf. II. 3. 132, and quid
est as an expression of assent.

enim does not here have its ex-
planatory force, but the earlier one
of in fact, as in quia enim, quippe
enim, immo enim. Cf. quisnam,
etc.—- concurritur, the onset comes.

8. momento, short space. — lae-
ta: as' enriching the soldier by
booty. These occupations are all
heire loolgd upon as means of gain

c . v. 2 .

9. ipris legumque peritus, the
learned man ῳ( law and statute,
though of course iuris, etc„ belong
to peritus. The jurisconsult‚ or
consulting lawyer‚ is referred to,
who was not an advocate, but gave
opinions for fees.— agricolam:
because he does not have to get up
at so early an hour.

10. sub galli cantum: as the
proceedings of the Roman courts
began at an early hour‚ the client
must get advice at a still earlier
one, but of course the statement
here is hyperbolical.

11. ille, the other.- datis vadi-
bus: the defendant, on answering
to the first summons in a court of
laW, gave bail for his appearance at

’ a subsequent day for the hearing.

Cf. Ι. 9. 36. — in urbem: all the
legal and other official business was
transacted in the city itself‚ though
many of the tribes lived many miles
away.—rure‚ i.e. from his sarm.
12. in urbe: naturally the coun-
tryman thinks those who live in the
