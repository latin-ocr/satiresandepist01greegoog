Nec sic incipieS, ut scriptor cyclicus olim :

‘ Dic mihi Musa virum, captae post tempora Troiae

qui mores hominum multorum vidit et urbes,'

Non fumum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo dare lucem

cogitat, ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat,

Antiphaten Scyllamque et cum Cyclope Charybdim ; 145

meric themes. Cf. the contrary· ·to-

131. publica, etc.: here, as else·

through keeping strictly to the con·

models.

133. curabis: best taken as a

134. desilies: i.e. plunge with·
out reflexion into a place where you
will be hampered by your respect
for your model, or by the laws of
the composition.

136. incipies: in an imperative
sense as a recommendation. Here

begins a new canon, namely, that
the plan of the work should have
a modest beginning, and rise in in-
terest to the end. — cyclicus: one
of the cycle of poets who imitated
and tried to complete or enlarge
upon the Iliad and Odyssey. Tradi-
tion says Antimachus' is meant.

138. hiatu. of the opening the
mouth to speak-

141. dic, etc.: Od. 1.1.

146. nec reditum, etc.: i.e. he
does not begin his subject with
irrelevant details„ so that the hearer
would be tired out before he comes
to the important point—Meleagri:
he was the uncle of Diomedes, so
that the stories would be remotely
connected, but not forming one
whole so as to be treated together.

147. ovo: i-e. from the birth of
