HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. II.

Res urget me nulla, meo sum pauper in aere.

Nemo hoc mangonum faceret tibi, non temere a me
quivis ferret idem. Semel hic cessavit et, ut fit,

in scalis latuit metuens pendentis habenae : ' 15
des nummOS, excepta nihil te si fuga laedit ;

ille ferat pretium poenae securuS, opinor.

Prudens emisti vitiosum, dicta tibi est lex3

insequeris tamen hunc et lite moraris iniqua.

Dixi me pigrum proficiscenti tibi, dixi 20
talibus officiis prope mancum, ne mea saevus ’
iurgares ad te quod epistula nulla rediret.

Quid tum profeci, mecum facientia iura

no more, for too many promises
make men suspicions when a man
wants to get rid of any article.

12. res, necessity.— meo . . .
aere, but out os debr, opposed to
aes alienum. —pauper, in humble
circumstances.

13. mangonum ε the regular
slave-deale1·5.— faceret: i.e. would
give you such a bargain—temere
. . . quivis, any chance person ,·
properly, without some special rea·
son: here, the desire to oblige a
friend.

14. cessavit, loitered, i.e. when
sent on an errand. Cf. Sat. II. 7.
100.

15. in scalis, etc.: a mild case
of running away. Cf. fuga, v. 16.
- metuens : with the genitive
properly indicating the slave's dis·
position, but in fact hardly to be
distinguished ,from the use of the
accusative. —pendentis: i.e. hung
up in terrorem. — habenae: the
lorum, or strap, from which one
or more of the slaves was called
lorarius.

16. des: apodosis to velit, v. 2.
—exceptau the technical term for
any express provision, mention, or
exception in a document or bargain.

Here it is used of the eiception of
the one fault from the general war-
ranty which was implied in the sale
of a slave. Cf. Aul. Gel. IV. 2 and
ἔξ ἓξὲἓζῗιζ, ⁸²‘'z-telioui‘rlr‘ieglalirfiidens

. . . ,
the opposite.—vitiosurn: the slave
would be eft-ro, or fugitivus, either
of which tendencies would be a
vitium. But-this fault having been
mentioned in the contract, no action
would arise on account of it. -lex:
τῖε. the conditions of the sale.

19. insequeris, etc.: another of
the cases in which the simile is
confused with the object. Florus'
action in regard to Horace amounts
to the same thing as the proceeding
mentioned. — moraris, try to hold
him, opposed to letting him go free
from damages.

20. dixi, I told you, with emphasis.

21 . maneum, incapacitated, prop-
erly, crippled in the hands.

22. rediret: cf. reddere, used of
delivering a letter, to which verb
redire forms a sort of passive. Cf.
perdo, pereo.

23. meeum facientia: i.e. that
are on my side. Cf. 11. 1. 68.—
iura, the law, i.e. the courts.
