HORATI SERMONES. 13

quanto perditior quisque est, tanto acrius urget ; 15
nomina sectatur modo sumpta veste virili

sub patribus duris tironum.

‘ Maxime’ quis non

‘ Iuppiter! ' exclamat, simul atque audivit? ‘At ιιι sc

pro quaes-kh sumptum facit hic)

Vix credere possis

quam sibi non sit amicuS, ita ut pater ille, Terenti 20
fabula quem miserum gnato vixisse fugato
inducit, non se peius cruciaverit atque hic.

Si quis nunc quaerat, ‘ Quo res haec pertinet?' illuc:
dum vitant stulti vitia, in contraria currunt.

15. quanto perditior, the near-
er to ruin. —quisque, one. This
use of quisque is common in
all kinds os comparisons to make
the idea more individual, as if it
said, ‘⁸ each man in proportion t0,'’
etc.

16. nomina, debts. In the ac·
count-books of the RomanS, the
name at the head of the ledger was
the evidence of debt; hence nomen
comes to be used for the account
(in all senseS, as in English), and
for the debt against one, where we
should say notes or bills. - sumpta,
etc. ‚just come to manhood, when of
course their desire sor leasure and
their dependence woul be greatest.
The manly toga, or plain white robe,
was put on at the pleasure of the
father about the age of seventeen,
and this (dies tirocinii) was an
important occasion in the life of the
young man, as he was then admitted
as a man among men.

17. duris, harsh, as not indulg-
ing their sons in their pleasureS,
whence the young men had more
need of money.

18. in se. .sumptum facit,
he spends upon himself

19. pro quaestu, in proportion
to his gains. —vix‚ etc-2 notice

that the connectives are constantly
omitted to give the freedom of con-
versation3 on tlte contrary, or
why!

2ο. quam non amicus, what
an enemy, as torturing himself with
privation in the miser’s fashion.—-
pater ille, the father, i.e. the well·
known one.

21. fabula: the Hautontimoru-
menos, or Self-Tormentor, of Ter·
enee. — miserum vixisse inducit,
shows living in wretchedness. The
word inducit properly means
brings on to the stage, but, as vixisse
is past, it means here‘ ‘shows to
have lived.’'

22. atque, than, a meaning and
use of atque often found in early
Latin.

23. quo.. ‚pertinet, whither . . .
tends, i. e. what is shown by these
examples?

24. dum vitant, ειο.ι the gene-
ral statement of the doctrine of the
mean as held by the Peripatetic
school.

25· Malthinus, etc.= examples
of extremes in other matters· There
is a supposed reference to MaecenaS,
but it might be any one of a hun·
dred others. —est qui (sc. ambu-
lat), another·
