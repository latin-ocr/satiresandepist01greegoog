SATIRE 5. There was at Rome
at the beginning of the Empire, in
consequence of the disorganization
bf society and the ease- with‘ which
fortunes had been acquired in the
civil war, a large number of rich
men and women for whom family
ties did not exist or were held in
little esteem. To ingratiate them·
selves into the favor of persons of
this class», and secure a rich inheri-
tance, became almost a profession
followed by many adventurers. It
is against this practice that Horace
directs this satire, in which he de·
scribes ironically the methods to be
pursued by the legacy hunter, appar-
ently as if they were perfectly legiti-
mate, and thus shows their contempt-
ible meanness, The directions are
put into the mouth of Tiresias and
addressed to Ulysses at the end of
the interview in the world below
(Hom. Odys. XI. 148), in which
Ulysses is assured by the seer of a
safe return, but only after losing
all his possessions. The satire has
thus the form of a travesty.

1. narrata: the statements of the
seer related in Od. XI. 90.

3. rides: the seer smiles at the

greed of mankind as shown by Ulys-
seS, who is not satisfied with escap-
ing with his life, but being assured
of that, at once wishes to get rich
again. — iam, already, when he is
assured of his Βία-(1010303 rep-

6. te vate, according to your
prophecy.

7. apotheca ε containing his
stores of grain, wine, and oil. —
procis ε the suitors of Penelope, who
lived as her guests in the house of
her husband while awaiting her de·
cision. (See Hom. Odys, Ι. 106 et
seq.).—pecus: both as means of
subsistence, and as constituting a
g'reat part of the wealth of a barbaric
chief. — atqui: the adversative turn
in the thought depends on an idea
not expressed; “I have birth and
worth, to be sure; yet they are worth-
less without money.’'

9. ambagibus: i.e. the excuse he
makes in et genus et virtus. etc.

10. turdus: a delicacy for the
table.
