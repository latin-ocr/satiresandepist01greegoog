HORATI EPISTVLAE. 221

Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum.

Sedit qui timuit ne non succederet.

Esto,

Quid, qui pervenit, fecitne viriliter? Atqui

hic est aut nusquam quod quaerimus, · Hic onus horret,
ut parvis animis et parvo corpore maius; · 40
hic subit et perfert. Aut virtus nomen inane est,

aut decus et pretium recte petit experiens vir.

36. non cuivis, etc.: i.e. the
nobleness of the career is shown by
the fact that everybody cannot suc-
ceed in it. This thought is put in
the form of the Greek proverb, οὐ
παντὸς ἀνδρὸς ἐς Κόρινθον ἔσθ’ ὖ
πλοῦς. The origin of the proverb
is unknown, but its form suggests a
quotation from some play. The ex-
planation of Gellius (I. 8) referring
it to the famous courtesan Lais
sounds like a later invention. But
at any rate the proverb carne to be
used of anything which everybody
could not attain.

37. sedit qui timuit, etc.: this
verse, which has the style of the sen-
tentious single-line colloquies of the
Greek tragedy, is either purposely
imitated by Horace from that style,
or it may possibly be actually quoted
from the same play as the proverb.
Although the connection is difficult,
and has been much. debated, it
seems best to take the statement as

wards turned to his own purpose in
the next verse. The sense would
be then: not every man can be the
friend of princes. To which the
other side of Horace’s mind, as it
were, replies (yeS, for) he sits inac-
tive, who fears he may not succeed.
“ Well, then,'' says Horace, “ he who
has tried and succeeded has shown
a manly spirit in doing what an-
other has feared to attempt, which
is thevery point in question, whether
itis a manly thing to do or not.'' —

sedit (gnomie perfect), lte sits in·
active.— succederet (impers.) t sc.
sibi.

38. pervenit: keeping up the
figure in v. 36.—fecitne, has he
not, etc.: the conclusion drawn from
the preceding, if the fear of failure
prevents men from trying to become
the friends of the great, then per

* contra it shows courage and manli-

ness to try and succeed.— atqui:
i.e. you must answer, yes, and yet
that gives away the whole case, for
that is just the' point, whether the
service of the great is a virile offi-
cium, and so praiseworthy‚ or is a
kind of slavery, and so unworthy
the true philosopher, as the Cynic
would hold.

39. quod quaerimus, the point
at issue, here not the object of
search, but the object of inquiry. —
hic: i.e. the one who sits inactive.
— onus horret: and thereby shows
a pusillanimity and weakness that is
foreign to the philosopher.

41. hic subit: the one who

' makes the attempt. He takes up

the burden, and carries it through
instead of shrinking from it. ‘ This
of course is an act of virtue, if there
is any such thing at alh-virtus:
apparently in this passage the
Roman meaning (cf. virtuS, sturdy
manhood, and courage to dc, dare,
and suffer) shines through the phil-
osophical sense in which Horace
professes to use it.

42. decus et pretium ε which are
attained in the service of the great
