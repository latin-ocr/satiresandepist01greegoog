Si potes Archiacis conviva recumbere lectis

EPISTLE 5. An invitation to din-
ner, addressed to Torquatus, prob-
ably the same to whom Oa'. IV. 7
is written. It is as if a jovial friend
should say to his busy and less
sels-indulgent companion, ‘⁶ Come,
let's have a dinner; it will do you
good. I will invite you, or, if you
are not content with my bill of fare,
then you invite me.'’ Which of the
many Torquati this is, is uncertain.
’ lugi, ιῗιῗέιῗιζαέιιῑεύἔιῖ Ϊιοῗιιῑιζῖῑζῗ
probably the well-known name of a
cheap wooden triclinium made by a
carpenter, Archias. Cf. “Windsor
chairs.'’—1ectis: cf. Sat. II. 8. 20
and note. .

2. modica: not sumptuouS, such
as the great man would be accus-
tomed to.— holus omne : any kind
of vegetables‚ lit. all kinds, not ex-
eluding the poorer. — patella, din-
ner service, the characteristic plate
offered to the Lares being put for
the whole. Cf. patera, Sat. 1. 6.
118.

3. supremo ε cf. primo sole,
prima luce. The dinner honr varied

from early asternoon to evening.
Cf. Sat. Ι. 6. 1 14. —maneb0, I shall
expect.

4. iterum Tauro (sc. consule) ι

the date is 13.c. 26, and the wine
would be about five or six years old,
respectable but not choice. — palus·
tris, etc.: a region of good wineS,

among which was the Massic.— .

diffusa, bottled, drawn off from the
great jars, in which it was first mad
into the amphora.

6. si melius, etc.: Torquatus is
bidden to come, unless he himself
has something better to offer in the
way of an entertainment, in which
case he is to invite Horace instead-
Cf. St. Jerome, Ep.48 (Migne,Vol. Ι.
p. 509), Α utprofer meliores epulas et
me conviva utere aut qualicumque
nostra cenula contentus este, where
the Father is evidently thinking of
this passage. ——arcesse, send or
me, invite me. — imperium er,
submit to my orders, as host or
master of the feast.

7. focus : the sacred symbolic
hearth‚ dedicated to the Lares, to
whom every meal was in a manner
a sacrifice. This had been polished
in anticipation of the occasion. Cf.
Epod. 2. 66.—supellex: the table
seEvice, which also had been put in
or er.

8. mitte: i.e. dismiss all cares of
business and ambition.

9. Moschi causam, a cause cdl&
