ring loosely to the place, but quoting
the most common form of the pro-
vision, as above given. locus, which
is often used, would be more exact.
— ne sequeretur, i.e. with the pro·
vision that, etc., quoted indirectly
from the language of the inscrip-
tions, Horace’s form implies a di-
rect sequatur‚ which does not occur
in full in inscriptions. The word,
however, is very rarely written out in
full, and the sense of non sequitur,
which does occur, is really the same.

14. nunc, etc.: later, apparently,
the burial place had been discon-
tinued in part, though tombs farther
out, perhaps beyond the agger of
Servius, were still remaining (see
v. 36).- salutaribus, i.e. andfind
it wholesome ,· in a predicate use.

15. aggere: the great earth-wall ’

built on the east side of the city by
Servius Tullius, part of which still
exists. Probably the ground was
appropriated to ordinary uses as far
as this, still leaving tombs beyond.
—quo, equal to ubi: referring to
the Esquiline in general, not to the

probably in search of the fruit, as in
v. 4, aves. Cf. also curae atque

lables.

19. carminibus atque venenis,
spells and charms‚ referring to the
whole magical paraphernalia. —
quae, the women who, i.e. who came
to this old cemetery for magic.
Everything connected with death
has been an instrument of witch-

20. perdere, confound: used
loosely as the active of pereant,
which would be his wish for them.

21. vaga: i.e. among the starS.

23. vidi: here begins the special
incident, and in a kind of epic style,
to produce a pseudo-pathetic effect.
—— nigra: as the funereal color. Cf.
the “black art.”-palla: we can
not be sure exactly what sort of a
dress she wore, but it was no doubt
different from the ordinary wear.
The palla seems to have been a
plain piece of cloth for drapery, but
