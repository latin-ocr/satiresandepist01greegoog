HORATI EPISTVLAE. 255

Multa quidem nobis facimus mala saepe poetae,

ut vineta egomet caedam mea, cum tibi librum 220
sollicito damus aut fess03 curn laedimur, unum

siquis amicorum est ausus reprendere versum,

cum loca iam recitata revolvimus irrevocati,

cum lamentamur non apparere labores '

nostros et tenui deducta poemata filo, - 225
cum speramus eo rem venturam, ut simul atque
carmina rescieris nos fingere, commodus ultro

arcessas et egere vetes et scribere cogas,

219. multa quidem, etc.: τ“.ε.
we ourselves are partly to blame in
several respects, first, when we are
not cautious in presenting our pro-
ductions to you at proper times.
We thereby produce an unfavorable
impression. Cf. the tone of Ι. 13,
and Sat. ΙΙ. 1. 18. —quidemz con-
cessive, opposed to sed tamen, v.
229.— mala, barm.

220. vineta, etc. τ proverbial, like
‘⁶ cut one’s own nose off,’' of doing
one's self an injury. It is implied
that Horace himself had thus of·
fended. Cf. citations under v. 219,
as well as Sat. 1. 3. 63.— caedam,
cut down, not merely prune.

221. cum laedimur, etc: τ“.ε.
or second, when we are too sensi·
tive to criticism, and are offended
by it.

223. cum loca, etc.: or third,
when in our conceit we repeat, with-
out being asked, what we consider
a fine passage. — recitata: of course
in this case the poem is supposed to
be presented by the author in per-
son, and read to the patron, as was
done by Virgil in the case os·the
Marcellus passage, AEn. VI. 860 seq.
-- revolvimus: notice the form of
the ancient book, a roll unwound
on one side, and rewound after
being read on the other.— irrevo-

cati: the regular word for recall,
ask to repeat, is revocare, derived

, from the stage; cf. Cic. pro Arch.

18.

224. cum lamentamur: i.e. or
fourth, when we complain that o'ur
work is not appreciated in propor-
tion to the labor we ex end on it,
and the subtlety (tenui of the art
which is in it.

225. deducta: a regular word
for poetical effort, derived from spin-
ning. Cf. Sat. 11. 1. 43 L 10. 44
note. -afilm also a common word
in reference to style. Cf. Cic. de
Am. 2 .

226.⁵cum speramus, etc.= or
when we hope for an instantaneous
result in patronage even before we
have accomplished anything. —eo
rem venturam, that the result will
be, τ“.ε. that we shall have the good
luck to get a commission at once to
write. These things, he would say,
are to be earned by worthy produc-
tion‚ not voluntarily given in ad·
vance.

227. fingere: τ“.ε. are engaged in
composition. — commodus τ τ“.ε.
obligingly. — ultro: τ”.ε. going out
of your way to invite us in.

228. egere vetes: i.e. put us
out of danger of want by presents.
