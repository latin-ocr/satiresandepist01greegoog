HORATI EPISTVLAE.

ΙΙ.

Troiani belli scriptorem, maxime Lolli,

dum tu declamas Romae, Praeneste relegi;

qui quid sit pulchrum, quid turpe, >quid utile, quid non,
plenius ac melius Chrysippo et Crantore dicit.

Cur ita crediderim, nisi quid te distinet, audi. 5
Fabula, qua Paridis propter narratur amorem

Graecia barbariae lento collisa due110,

stultorum regum et populorum continet aestus,

Antenor censet belli praecidere causam:

Emsm ι. This epistle, again,
is an exhortation to the study of
philoso hy, but of philosophy as
drawn rom the practical examples
given in the Iliad and Odyssey. It
is apparently addressed to a young
man not yet devoted to philosophy,
and seeks to win him to that pur·
suit by showing
can be got from literature apart-
srom the abstruse discussions of the
sages. Which of several Lollii, of
whom we have accounts, this one
was, and even whether he is the
same who is addressed in Ι. 18, is
uncertain. A Lollius also appears
in od. IV. 9.

1. maxime. probably half in
jest in allusion to his aspirations
and promise (flower qfthe house qs
Lollius, or the like).

2. declamas. the technical word
for the exercises practised in the
study of oratory. — Praeneste. one
of the favorite retiring places or
country resorts of the Romans.

3. pulchrum: τὸ καλὸν, τὸ πρέ·
τον, in a technical sense sor virtu-
ous conduct. -turpe· τὸ αἰσχρὸν,
the opposite. — utile. χρηστὸν, ad-

quid nont ἄχρηστον,

what moral lessons

injurians.

The whole contains the sum and
substance of the fundamental ques-
tion of ethics. Cf. Aristone Nico·
mach, Eth. 11. 2.

4. plenius: in reference to the
range FFtvpics. — melius ι in ref-
erence to c earness and convincing
power.—Chrysippo: cf. Sat. Ι. 3.

tempor ary with Chrysippus. The
use of these distinguished exam·
ples gives the meaning, ‘than any
philosopher.”

5. distinet. properly,‘ ‘distracts
your attention,’ 'meaning, keeps you
busy, and prevents you from giving
attention to philosophy.

7. barbariae. iae. Asia, asafor·
eign country to the Greeks.

8. stultorum. and hence exam-
ples of the opposite os sapientia.
—aestuffi desordered passsam· with
an allusion to the philosophical idea
of sever or other unsoundness m the
passions.

9. Antenor· an example of a
philosopher to whom Paris refuses
to listen. —praeeidere· depending
on censet used in the sense of a
verb of commanding. For the ref·
erence, cf. II. VII. 347 seq. Livy
