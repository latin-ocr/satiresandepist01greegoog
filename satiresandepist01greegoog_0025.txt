ore trahit quodcumque potest atque asidit acerVO,·
quem struit,'haud ignara ac non incauta futuri. 35
Quae, simul inversum contristat Aquarius annum,
non usquam prorepit et illis utitur ante x

quaesitis sapiens 3 c‘um te neque fervidus aestus

demoveat luem, neque hiempS, igniS, mare, ferrum,

nil obstet tibi, dum ne sit te ditior alter. ’ 40
Quid iuvat immensum te argenti pondus et auri

furtim defossa timidum deponere terra?

‘ Quod si comminuas, vilem redigatur ad assem.'

At ni id fit, quid habet pulchri constructus acervus?

presumed.—exemplo est, slze is
their patient, τῖε. they justify them-
selves by her example, but, as Hor·
ace shows, their conduct is different
from hers. See v. 36.—1aboris:
a qualitative genitive. That con-
struction is unusual without a gen·
eral word like animal, but this
may be a conversational idiom.

36. inversum, changing, closing,·
lit. turned back to begin again. —
Aquarius: the sun is in this con-
stellation about the middle of Jan·
uary, at which time really begins
the short Italian winter.

38. sapiam, tle. she knows
enough to gather provision in sum·
mer and stay at home in winter3
another reading, patiens, which is
very old, would mean contented, not
greedy for more. Cf. II. 6. 91.-·—
cum te, etc„ i.e. though the searcher
for gain makes the ant his pattern,
yet he does not follow her in her
use os what she gets but still ac·
cumulates, undeterred by any peril.
—aestaffi etc.: proverbial expres-
sions for obstacles, just as we say
ς “ go through fire and water.''

40. dum ne, so long as . . . not,
τῖε. provided you can outstrip your
neighbor in getting gain (cf. Cic.

de Off. 3. 21 ) .— alter, your neighbor. q
Alter is used for any one of a class
opposed to some particular person
mentioned.

41. quid iuvat Ρ i.e. what good
does this acquisition of wealth do,
which you don’t use?—immen·
sum, enormous, countless.

42. furtim, etc., stealthily. The
picture is of a miser hiding his gold
in the earth (the usual place in
ancient times) while anxiously watch-
ing that no one shall see where.

43. quod si, etc.: the miser’s
reply. The moment you begin to
take from the heap it all goeS.
“ Change a ten-dollar bill, and it is
all gone.''—- assem: the copper
coin of account of the Romans,
worth at this time about one cent.

44. at ni: Horace’s reply. —
quid pulchri: a colloquial form
of expression for the abstract. —
acervus: notice that, as the main
idea is that of amassing wealth gen·
erally, the figure under which the
wealth is represented constantly
changes. ⁷
