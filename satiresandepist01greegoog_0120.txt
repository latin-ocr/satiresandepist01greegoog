Ianum

ad medium fracta est, aliena negotia cur0,

Olim nam quaerere amabam, 20

quo vafer ille pedes lavisset Sisyphus aere,

quid sculptum infabre, quid fusum durius esset ;
callidus huic signo ponebam milia centum 3

cum lucro noram3 unde frequentia Mercuriale 25
imposuere mihi cognomen compita. Hor. Novi,

et miror morbi purgatum te illius.

you must be content to lay aside. —
di te, etc.= Horace replieS, begin-
ning as if he were going to wish
Damasippus the greatest blessings,
but ends with the thing he thinks
the philosopher needs most, a bar-
ber, on account of the long beard
affected by philosophers.

18. postquam, etc.: in answer
to Horace's query, how Damasippus
came to know him so well, the Stoic
replies, that, having failed in his
own business, he has taken up other
people'S, that is to say, has become
aeptssltffffitsssfflfflffi, ἓξ

which were the shops of. the money
lenders. Damasippus means that
his fortune was lost by borrowing
money, and making unprofitable in-
vestments.

21. quo . . . aere: a humorous

· 27. morbi: in accordance with.
the Stoic way of thinking, Horace
speaks of this devotion to gain as a
disease (πάθος) or insanity. The
genitive is in imitation of the Greek
construction of separation, justified,
however, by the Latin construction
of relative adjectives. Cf. plenus
and vacuus.
