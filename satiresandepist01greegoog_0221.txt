and so presents a picture of inac-
· tivity.—Vacunae: a Sabine deity,
either really a god of vacations
(vaco), or mistakenly supposed to
be such. For the form, cf. Fortuna,
Portunus. The character of the
goddess heigbtens the picture of
idleness

50. laetus: no doubt with an
allusion to the contentment which
he recommends to Fuscus in v. 44.

EPISTLE 11. The Bullatius to
whom this epistle is addressed is
not otherwise known. He appears

to have been for some reason trav- ’

elling for pleasure in Asia Minor in
the same manner as we now visit
European cities. Horace takes occa·
sion to express as a contrast to the
love of foreign lands his own impa-
tience of the evils of the transit and
his preference for home.

1. quid tibi, etc. : amounting
merely to ‘⁴ how did you like?’'
For the use os quid, cf. Sat. Ι. 6.
55. —— nota, famous.

2. concinna, well built, probably

. alluding to the regularity of its

building5‚ such as is osten admired
in the newer Paris.—regia‚ royal

abode. — θαι-(ΠΒ t Σάρδεις.

3. maiora: for the gender, cf.
quid, v. 3.

4. prae campo, etc.= tle. in com-
parison with the scenes of home. —
sordent, etc.= the three questions

= are: “Do you prefer your native

home,zor would you desire to live
in one of these famous and wealthy
cities, or, finally, do you find the
meanest place attractive after the
discomforts of travel? '’ As for him-
self, Horace goes on to say, he would
rather live in the most wretched old
town than cross the sea even to get
home. The poet's dislike of the sea
appears also in Od. 1. 3 and II. 6. 7.
7. Gabiis, Fidenis: these towns,
once famous, fell into decay after
being captured by the Romans, and
became almost proverbial for deso·
latiori. Cf. Juv. VI. 56 and X. 100.
8. vellem: the contrary-to-sact
condition implied is, ‘is it were my
casess or ‘ Ι were there,’ or the like.
9. obliviscendus: apparently in
the sense of a present passive par·
ticiple, a signification which this
form must earlier have had (Gr.
ξ 296, note).
10. Neptunum, ete: the ker-
nel is in the procul e terra. He
would live there forever, and look
