HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. ΙΙ.

fiet aper, modo avis, modo saxum, et, cum volet, arbor.
Si male re'm gerere insani est, contra bene sani,
putidius multo cerebrum est, mihi crede, Perelli 75
dictantis quod tu numquam rescribere possis,

Audire atque togam iubeo componere, quisquis

78. ambitione, etc.: the four
forms of insanity are ambition, ava-

this as the revailing and most ruin-
ous form ofinsanity.
