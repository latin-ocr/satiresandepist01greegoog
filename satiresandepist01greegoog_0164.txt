SATIRE 7. Horace here makes
sport of the Stoic paradox, “ Solum
sapientem esse liberum et omnem
stultum servum ” (cf. Ι. 3 and ΙΙ.
3). In thia, however, as in the other
cases, the poet uses the truth under·
lying the paradox to ridicule the
follies of mankind, including him-
self. The argument is put into the
mouth of his slave, who represents
himself as having got his teachings
through the doorkeeper of the Stoic
preacher, Crispinus (cf. 1. 1. 120).
To give probability to the license of
the slave, he sets the scene at ,the
Saturnalia, during which, in memory
of the Golden Age, the equality of
all men was in a manner recog·
nized. ’

«ι. ausculto, etc.; as the master
is busy, apparently writing or think·
ing, he does not see the slave, who,
after listening by the door to see
whether his master is engaged with
anybod-y, finally ventures to make
his presence known. ΤΙῚε master
still does not look up, but recognizes
him by his voice.

2. Davusne, is it you, Davus?
For the name, cf. II. 5. 91.

3. frugi, an honest fellow (cf. 11.
5. 77), referring to the virtues of
industry, sobriety, and the like.

4. ut vitale, etc., not too good to
live: ef. “the good die young,'' a
familiar notion with the ancients
(cf. Plaut. Bacch. 8163 Ov. Am. ΙΙ.
6. 39).—libertate Decembri: τῖε.
of the Saturnalia.

6. pare, etc.: the slave in Hor·
ace's regular manner approaches the
subject gradually (cf. v. 21), begin-
’3ξῖἰέῑὶῑὶῗῶἳὲἱΐῗὲξξέἳὶέῑὲἐῗῖἓξ
vice with vigor, and those who
weakly show their feebleness of
purpose even in vieious courses.

’7. natat, drifl.

8. notatus, conspicuous, but with
a shade of blame in it, on account
of the display of luxury and effemi-
nacy. ⁴

9. Priscus: a man of senatorial

rank, an example of this ilicon-

sistency, and want of constant pur-
posng. inaequalis: cf. 1. 3. 9. —
clavum mutaret: i.e. from broad
to narrow, now appearing with pride “
as a senator, now as a simple eques.
