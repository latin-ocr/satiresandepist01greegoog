HORATI EPISTVLAE.

293

in scaenam missos cum magno pondere versus 260
aut operae celeris nimium curaque carentis

. aut ignoratae premit artis crimine turpi.

Non quivis videt immodulata poemata iudex,

⁴ et data Romanis venia est vindigna poetis.

Idcircone vager scribamque licenter, an omnes 265
visuros peccata putem mea, tutus et intra
spem veniae cautus ? Vitavi denique culpam,

non laudem merui.

Vos exemplaria Graeca

nocturna versate manu, versate diurna.

· At vestri proavi Plautinos et numeros et 270
laudavere saleS, nimium patienter utrumque,

ne dicam stulte, mirati, si modo ego et vos

scimus inurbanum lepido seponere dicto,

legitimumque sonum digitis callemus et aure.

Ignotum tragicae genus invenisse Camenae 275
dicitur et plaustris vexisse poemata ThespiS,

ful lines are matred by carelessness
or want of knowledge of art.

260. cum magno pondere: cf.
sine pondere, 11. 2. 112.

262. premit: i.e. the iambuS,
from its omission.

263. non quivi8‚ etc.: i.e. but
the Romans are not good judges of
rhythm, and so the metrical faults
of these early poets are par·
doned. .

264. indigna, undeserved, that
ought not to have been⁸ granted.

265. idcircone: i.e. because oth·
ers have been pardoned.-vager,
take liberties. — an, or ratker, the
second alternative being preferred
as usual.

267. vitavi, etc.: i.e. if I do ex·
ercisc this care, 1 have after all
desei-ved no credit, but only avoided
blame, implying that it would be a
disgrace to him not to do sc.

268. v08‚ etc.: i.e. I recommend
you to study the true models, and

aim at something higher than merely
escaping censure.

270. at vestri, etc. ι a loose chap-
ter in which the poet, being re-
minded by the mention of careless
metre of the faults of Plautus in
that regard, criticises the taste of
the ancients on account of their
admiration of the careloes writing of
Plautus. This admiration extended
both to the verse and the wit of Plau·
tus, and on both these points Hor-
ace finds him unworthy as a model.
Giving a brief account of the rise
of the drama, Horace comes to his
ever-prese nt idea that careful compo-
sition is the one indispensable virtue.

271. patienter, with indulgence.

273. inurbanum z i.e. coesse,
unpolished, the characteristic of
Plautus,

276. Thespis: cf. 11. 1. 163.—
plaustris: apparently an erroneous
notion, to which Horace’s words
here have given currency.
