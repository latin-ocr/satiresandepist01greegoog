290 HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 11.

mox etiam agrestis Satyros nudavit, et asper

incolumi gravitate iocum tentavit e0, quod

illecebris erat et grata novitate morandus

spectator, functusque sacris et potus et exlex.

Verum ita risoreS, ita commendare dicacis 225
conveniet Satyros ita vertere seria ludo, Α

ne quicumque deu3, quicumque adhibebitur herOS‚

regali conspectus in auro nuper et ostro,

migret in obscuras humili sermone tabernaS,

aut, dum vitat humum, nubes et inania captet. 230
Effutire levis indigna tragoedia verSUS,

7⁰5, considered as the prize of the
rivalry in song. This view assumes
that there were contests in the ear-
- lier timeS, as there were later.

221. mox etiam: i.e. the Satyr
drama followed very early the in·
vention of Tragedy. — agrestis Sa-
tyros: it would appear from the
directions given that the Satyric
drama was also cultivated at Rome,
at least by authors, Whether such
plays were ever acted is uncertain.
- nudavit: the Satyrs as wild
creatures naturally appeared with
the upper and lower part of their
bodies really or apparently naked.
—asperz i .e. rude and simple in art.

222. gravitate: i.e. the dignity
of the occasion as one of worship,
and one in which gods and heroes
appeared.

2²3· morandus: i.e. after the
tragedies and the completion of the
serious part of the festival.

224. saeris: the festival of Di-
onysus, in whose honor the trag-
edy was performed. —exlexz freed
from restraint by the festival char-
acter of the day. The picture does
not differ much from that in v. 210,
though Horace assigns the two to
different times. It would seem that
Horace conceived the Satyric drama

as an outlet sor the merriment os
the spectator, designed to keep him
out of mischief in his riotous condi-
tion.

225. verum, etc.: but even in
this riotous performance a middle
course is recommended as the law
of the work, so that the dignity of
the higher characters should still be
preserved, though the humorous
aspects of the situation are to be
brought out. — risores: in accord-
ance with their nature the Satyrs
were a merry crem—dicacis: i.e.
making sport of the humors of the
situation, sarcastic and abusive.

226. seria: the Satyr drama was
far removed from Comedy. In the
only one preserved, the Cyclops of
Euripides, the characters are Ulys-
seS, SilenuS, the CyclopS, and a
Chorus of Satyrs. The plot is
treated as seriously as in a tragedy‚
onlya comie myth is used instead
of a tragic one, and the humorous
aspects of the situation are brought
out.

228. conspectus nuper: τῖε. in
the tragedy which had preceded.

230. nubes, etc.: i.e. the style
should not, on the other hand, be
too grandiloquent for the situation.

231. effutire, etc.: the cantion
