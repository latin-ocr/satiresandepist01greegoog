HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 1.

Si forte in medio positorum abstemius herbis

vivis et urtica, sic vives protinus, ut te

confestim liquidus Fortunae rivus inauret;

vel quia naturam mutare pecunia nescit, 10
vel quia cuncta putas una virtute minora.

Miramur, si Democriti pecus edit agellos

cultaque, dum peregre est animus sine corpore velox,
cum tu inter scabiem tantam et contagia lucri¹

nil parvum sapias et adhuc sublimia cures ε ¹ 15
quae mare compescant causae 3 quid temperet annum ;
stellae sponte sua iussaene vagentur et errent ;

quid premat obscurum lunae, quid proferat ‘orbem ;

quid velit et possit rerum concordia discors ;

more even in the midst of wealth, in

ι which ease a fortune would do him

no good.

7. in medio positorum, what is
ready at hand, i.e. the abundance
of Agrippa's house.

8. urtica, cf. Plin. H. N. XXI.
15. 93.— ugammessive. .

10. vel ‘quia‚ etc. ε i.e. your
nature is such that money wouldn't
spoil it, and besides, your philo-
sophical studies have given you true
views of virtue and all other goods.

12. miramur, etc.: an indirect
proof of the philosophical enthusi-
asm of Iccius, and so still more
indirectly of the truth of v. 11.—
Democriti: the great atomist of
Abdera, the Laughing Philosopher‚
of whom the story was told alluded to
in v. 12. Cf. Democritus ul quam
minime animus a cogitationibus
abduceretur patrimonium neglexit,
agros deseruit incultos, Cic. de Fin.
V. 29. 87.

14. inter scabiem, etc: tle. the
times of Democritus were less worldly
than our own, and hence it is a
stronger proof of devotion to phi-
losophy when you study such themes

amid the present race for wealth
than when Democritus did so.
15. nil parvum, etc„ stu& no

petty Ἰαὼ-ἄση,- i.e. are not drawn

away from lofty themes to the petty
interests of the day. — sublimia,
celestial themes (τὰ μετέωρα), i.e. the
study of the heavenS, pure science,
the questions enumerated below.

16. mare compescant: i.e.con-
trpl the waves.

17. iussaene: whether there is
any law in their movement as natu-
ral bodies, or whether they are di·
rected by mechanical forces, unttam-
melled by law.

18. obscurum: a kind of predi-
cate adjective belonging only with
premat.

19. quid velit: i.e. what it meam,
or aims at.--possit: i.e. what are
the limits of its power, as the ques-

= tion is spoken of in LucretiuS, quid

fieri possit et quid non, particularly,
no doubt, in reference to the influ-
ence of celestial phenomena on hu·
man affairs—concordia discors,
tlze dissentient harmony, i.e. various
in manifestation, but joined in a
common plan3 cf. v, 20.
