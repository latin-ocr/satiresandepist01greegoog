HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 1.

III.

Iuli Flore, quibus terrarum militet oris

ClaudiuS, Augusti privignus, scire laboro,

Thracane vos Hebrusque nivali compede vinctus,

an freta vicinas inter currentia turriS,

an pingues Asiae campi collesque morantur? 5
Quid studiosa cohors operum struit? Hoc quoque curo,
Quis sibi res gestas Augusti scribere sumit ?

Bella quis et paces longum diffundit in aevum?

Quid Titius, Romana brevi venturus in ora,

Pindarici fontis qui non expalluit haustus, 10
fastidire lacus et rivos ausus apertos? Α
Vt valet? Vt meminit nostri? Fidibusne Latinis

Epts‘rLE 3. This epistle‚ of a less
general character than the two pre-
ceding, is only a familiar letter ad·
dressed to a friend, Julius Florus.
He was at the time one of the suite

cohors amicorum) of Tiberius

cf. notes to Sat. 1. 5.), who was
then (B.c. 20) in Armenia with an
army threatening Parthia.

1. Iuli Flore: the full name is
a little formal and serious. He ap-
pears also in 11. 2.

2. Claudius: T iberius Claudius
Ner0. —privignust this descrip-
tion is meant as a compliment, and
the gentile name alone is respectful
in the case of a dignitary. —laboroz
cf. Sal. ῙῙ. 8. 19.

3. Thracane, etc.: the route of
an army would be through Thrace,
across the Hellespont over through
Asia Minor into Armenia. The
question is only a formal way of
asking how far along he is on his
march. - vinctus: not at the time,
but proverbially so as being in a
cold region.

4. turris: Sestos and Abydos

6. studiosa, etc.: all the young
nobles were litterateurs to some ex·
tent. In fact, such had been often
taken in the suite of a commander
ever since Ennius went into AEtolia
with Fulvius.

8. diffundit: i.e. preserves the
memory of them in literature. Cf.
11. 3. 346, and Od. IV. 14. 3.

9. Titius: unknown, except from
the allusion here.—venturus: i.e.
about to become famous, a prophecy
apparently not sulfilled.

10. Pindarici: he seems to have
attempted the Pindaric ode, for the
difficulty of which, cf. Od. IV. 2.

11. lacus et rivos apertos: al-
luding to the quieter style of ordi-
nary poets‚ as opposed to the moun-
tain torrent of piudan—apertos:
in the open plain, not in woods or '
mountains.

12. fidibusne, etc. (cf. Od. III.
30. 13): i.e. does he still attempt
the ode, and with succesS, or has
he abandoned it sor the turgid elo-
quence of the drama?
