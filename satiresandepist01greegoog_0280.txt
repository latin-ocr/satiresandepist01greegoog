HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. 11.

si quantum cuperem possem quoque: sed neque parvum
carmen maiestas recipit tua, nec meus audet

rem temptare pudor, quam vires ferre recusent.
Sedulitas autem stulte quem diligit urget, 260
praecipue cum se numeris commendat et arte;

discit enim citius meminitque libentius illud,

quod quis deridet quam quod probat et veneratur.

Nil moror officium quod me gravat, ac neque ficto

in peius voltu proponi cereus usquam, 265
nec prave factis decorari versibus opto,

ne rubeam pingui donatus munere et una

cum scriptore meo capsa porrectus operta

deserar in vicum vendentem tus et odores

et piper et quicquid chartis amicitur ineptis 270

be found in the fact that they had
been so long the most dreaded ene-
mies of Rome, though the actual
events of their subjection were not
very memorable.

258. recipit, admit, i.e. is too
great for, so that you would not be
justified in receiving it; and, on the
other hand, my modesty is too great
to allow me to try.

260. sedulitas, ffcious devotion.
—stulte: with emphasis, i.e. it is
foolish sor one to do so.—urget‚
depreciate, as a man of inferior tal·
ent would do in attempting to exalt
the object of his praise„

261. praecipue, etqu i.e. espe-
cially in an ambitious work like
poetry‚ in which art and grace count
for so much. For the good is for-
gotten, but the faults are remem-
bered.

264. officium, dutiful service,
i.e. a tribute of respect such as a
poem would be. -— gravat, lowers

my dignity. — ac, and consequently.
-nequez i.e. neither to be rep·
resented in portraiture (a truism,
with which the other is compared),
nor to be praised in ill-wrought
verse (gny more than the first). Cf.

267. pi⁵ngui2 cf. Cic. de Fato,
cited under v. 244, and Sat. ΙΙ. 6.
14. — munere, tribute, the poem
referred to.

268. curn scriptore, etc.: i.e.
that we should· both be consigned
to oblivion. The figure treats only
of the poem, which is supposed to
be carried off packed up in a waste·
paper basket, to be used sor wrap·
ping·paper. Into this oblivion (re-
gardless of the figure, except in
porrectus, stretched out as on a
bier), the eulogized is to accompany
his eulogist.

269. vicum: i.e. the Vicus Tus·
cus. With this jest the letter closes
in Horace’s usual manner.
