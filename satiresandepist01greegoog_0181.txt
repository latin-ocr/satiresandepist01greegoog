Tm: Epistles belong, as well as the SatireS, to Horace's
Musa pedestris. They are, like them, conversational moral or
literary essays (Sermones,· cf. 11. 1. 250), of which the topics
are suggested by current events or occasional moods and rela-
tions. They were not, however, called Sermones by the an-
cients, nor do they have that title in the manuscriptS, but have
always been called Epistulae. They differ from the Satires in
being connected in some manner with some particular person
to whom each is addressed. They are not, to be sure, letters

like those of Cicero and Pliny, originally intended for private ‘-

reading and afterwards collected and published. They were
from the first intended for the public, But it must be remem-
bered that publication in ancient times was a different matter
from what it is nowadays. The author sent his manuscript to
be read and copied, and it would be put on sale if it was found
to be popular. The only difference between these letters and
other compositions was probably that these were first sent to
the person addressed and afterwards copied by his permission.
They were written after Horace's fame became established, so
that any person was honored by being associated with one of
his compositions. But the association is not merely one of
dedication. Each one seems to have been suggested by some
condition of mind, trait of character, or temporary situation of
the person addressed. So that there is something persona] and
intimate in the tone and matter of each of them. The date of
their composition is not exactly fixed except in a few caseS, but
they belong to the latter part of the poet's life (see Ι. 3 3 Ι. 20),
about B.c. 20-12, later than any other of his works, except some
