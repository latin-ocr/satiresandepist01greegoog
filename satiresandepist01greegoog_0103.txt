Book 11.

SAT1RE r. Tbere is no distinct
evidence that the two books of
Satires were published separately

. 'so as to need an introduction to

each, yet this Satire serves as a sort
of introduction to the second book,
as Satire Ι. 1. is an introduction to
the whole. We have in this a de-
fence of the poet’s· treatment of sat-
ire, in answer to the many charges
which had been made by his ene·
mies and crines, upon the reading
of the various pieces in a rather
large circle os friends. That the
Satires must have been given to the
world separately in this quasi-public
way appears from Ι. 2. 27 and 1. 4.
92. The conception o( the piece
is perfectly natural, and in the
highest degree witty and humorous.
Horace is supposed to take advice
of an old lawyer as to his proper
course, in view of the contradictory
criticisms made upon his work;

and in the conversation which en-
sues he treats the subject from all
sides, while at the same time he
keeps the person of the lawyer dis-
tinet from his own in a perfectly
dramatic form. As a piece os corn-
position it could hardly be excelled.

1. satura. here, sor the first timej
in literature, this word seems to be ι
used in the sense to which it has
later been confined. — videor. the}
mood of the verb seems to imply¹
that he has definite persons in mind,
but it is always the privilege of a
poet to speak as if he had, whether
he has or not (cf. Od. Ι. 1. 3).—
acer: i.e. in his criticism or invec-
tive.

2. legem, i. e. the proper limits
of the style of composition (cf. A.
P. 135)'. —tendere‚ fine, a figure
taken from the bow. — sine nervia,
just the opposite fault to the first,
without fhce, being mere inartistic

rose.

p 4. deduci, spun ἔξ· ‘keeping the
same figure. — Tre ati, C. Treba-
tius Testa, a jurisconsult‚ or con
sulting lawyer, in his youth a friend
of Cicer03 cf. Cic. ad Fam. VII. 6
and 22. ΤΙιθ shortness and authori
tative manner of his answers (cf.
quiescas, v, 5, and aio, v. 6) indi-
cate an old and experienced lawyer,.
though at that time he could not
have been much above fifty, while
Horace was about thirty.

technieal term for giving directions
