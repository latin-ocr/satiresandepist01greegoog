46 HORATI SERMONES.

esse feri similem dico!

· Messius ‘Accipio,' caput et movet.

[Lm. I.

RidemuS, et ipse

‘ O, tua cornu

ni foret exsecto fronS,' inquit, ‘ quid faeereS, cum

sic mutilus miniteris ? '

At illi foeda cicatrix

saetosam laevi frontem turpaverat oriS.

Campanum in morbum, in faciem permulta iocatuS,
pastorem saltaret uti Cyclopa rogabat 3

nil illi larva aut tragicis opus esse cothurnis.

Multa Cicirrus ad haec: Donasset iamne catenam 65
ex voto LaribuS, quaerebat ; scriba quod esset,

nilo deterius dominae ius esse: rogabat

denique, cur umquam fugisset, cui satis una

farris libra foret, gracili sic tamque pusillo,

posed ferocity. The comparison
was partly on. account of his size
and uglineSS, partly on account of
the sear referred to in v. 61.

58. accipio: as if he said, “ So 1

animal.— Ο tua, etc.: the reply of
Sarmentus: ‘⁶ How dangerous you
would be if you hadn't had your
horn cut off.'’ Messius had had a
great wen (Campanus morbus) re·
moved from his orehead.—-cornu,
abl. of quality.

60. sic, thus . . . as you are.-at‚
now, introducing the explanatory
words of Horace.

61. saetosam: tle. a hairy scat
was left.

62. Campanum: diseases aris·
ing from loose living which disfig·
ure the face or body are regularly
assigned to some foreign country,
as by the English to France‚ by the
French to Italy.

63. pastorem: a cognate acc„
like “to play Hamlet.'’ ΤῘιε point
is in the ugliness, huge size, and
scarred forehead (representing a
cyclops' eye) of the buffoon, all of
which agreed with the character of

PolyphemuS, whose hopeless love
for Galatea was a favorite theme
with the ancientS, somewhat like
Beauty and the Beast.—sa.ltaret:
i.e. to act in pantomime.

65. multa: the chaffing of Cicir-
rus 1s aimed at the servile condition
of Sarmentus as well as his diminu-
tive size. Much of the fun to a
Roman would lie in the contrast
between the puny, dainty favorite
from the city and the huge, over-
grown countryman with his pheno·
menal ugliness ; and it will be seen
that their abuse of each other is
directed at these peculiarities. Such
cross·matches had a charm for the
RomanS, as we see by some of their
gladiatorial contests. — donasset:

manumitted slaves to make an of-
fering to the household godS, though
probably not of a chain, an allusion
which ism in analogy to
cases like Od. III. 26. 4, Ep. Ι. 1. 5.

68. cui satis, etc.: he might have
saved enough from his rations, such
ἓ puny fellow as he, to buy his free-

om.
