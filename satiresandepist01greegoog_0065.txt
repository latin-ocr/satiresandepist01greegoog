state travellers. It may be that they
were in this case bound to supply
only certain articles, the travellers
bringing the rest, or the words ligna
salemque, may mean entertainment
generally, with a hint at its meagre-
nesS. Cf. v. 50.

47. hinc, from herm i.e. start-
ing the next morning—Capuae,
twenty-two miles farther on, the
largest and most important city
of Campania. —rnulit the baggage
only is mentioned, but the whole
train is referred to. ’ ,

48. lusum: sc. pila (cf. v. 49),
for exercise before dinner as was the
custom of the Romans, while the
two poets took a nap instead, as
was also not unusual.

49. pila: the Romans had sev·
eral games of ball which consisted
chiefly in throwing and catching, the
use of the bat being a modern im-
provement. Cf. 1. 6. 126.— lippis,
to sore eyes.— et crudis, and weak
stomacbs. The word means proper·
ly undigested, but was regularly
transferred to the dyspeptic him·
self.

50. plenissima, well-stocked. Cf.
v. 46.—vi11a: many noble Romans
had country-seats in various parts
of Italy.

N< 51. Caudi: Caudium, the scene
of the great defeat of the Romans

Prior Sarmentus ε ‘ Equi te

by the Samnites, was in the moun· ι
tain region of the Hirpini, twenty-
one miles from Capua, eastward
towards the ApennineS. —- super, on
the heights above the town..— nunc
mihi, etc.: the poet again assumes
the Epic style. Τὴε scene described
was evidently of a kind very com-
mon ’among the rich RomanS, who
were particularly fond of these scur-
rilous encounters. Cf. the word
scurra, and Plin. Ep. IX. 17.

52. Sarmenti: abuffoon (scurra)
accompanying the expedition in the
capacity of clerk.— Messi Cicirri:
a person of the same kind belong·
ing in the town, and so no doubt
brought out by Cocceius, who was
familiar with the region, to pit
against the favorite from Rome.
Cicirrus (κίκιρρος, cock) is a nick-
name. ·

53. quo patre; the genealogy of
the hero is always a matter of in-
terest in romance. The burlesque
here is the more striking because
Sarmentus as a slave was filius
nullius, and Messius was a de·
spised Osean.

54 Osci: predicate of est to be
supplied with genuS, which is here
equivalent to a plural, as meaning
the man's ancestorS.

fabled unicorn, famous for its sup-
