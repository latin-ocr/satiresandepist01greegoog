xv11. 1-22.] HORATI EPISTVLAE.

te tractare voleS, accedes siccus adimetum.
‘Si pranderet holus patienter, regibus uti
nollet Aristippus.' ‘ Si sciret regibus uti,
fastidiret holus qui me notat.’ Vtrius horum
verba probes et facta, doce, vel iunior audi
cur sit Aristippi potior sententia. Namque
mordacem Cynicum sic eludebat, ut aiunt:

‘ Scurror ego ipse mihi, populo tu ; rectius hoc et
splendidius multo est. Equus ut me portet, alat rex, ω

officium facio tu poscis vilia rerum
dante minor, quamvis fers te nullius egentem!

12. tractaret cf. Sat. II. 2. 85.
melri3ts grptrlient‘isgegoffitgs'oi'hfifeerffle
put into the mouths of Diogenes the
Cynic and Aristippus the Hedonist

cf. 1. 1. 18 .
Svhich the iiiterview is paraphrased
is told by Diog. Laert. ΙΙ. 68. —
regibus: in the original τύραννος,
but here used in reference to mag·
nates generally.

14. si sciret, etc. z in accordance
with the general views of Aristip-
puS, cf. 1. 1. 19.

15. qui me notat, i.e. my censor,
the term being derived from the
action of the Censor at Rome. —

The anecdote from

utrius horum, etc.: the poet puts
the alternative directly, whether a
man should scorn the advantages of
intercourse with the great, like the
Cynic, or make the most of them,
like the versatile Aristippus.

16. doce, etc.: i.e. either con·
vince me, or else, being younger,
listen to my decision of the point.

17. namque, etc.= i.e. I say
Aristippus’ view is better, for he
had a valid reply to the reproach of
Diogenes.

18. mordacem: in allusion to
the etymology of Cynic from κύων.
-- eludebat, parried. The imper-

fect represents that his answer was
a possible regular reply to such an
argument.

19. scurror, I play the parasite,
implying that Diogenes had in
effect taunted him with being a
scurra. The reply is, ‘⁴ We both
are that3 but 1 am so for my own
benefit‚ you for the crowd3 and my
way is much happier and more
noble.'' ·- hoc: referring to his own
way, which is nearer in fact, though
farther away on the page. See
A.&G. § 102.— rectius: cf. recte,
Ι. 12. 2.

20. equus, ete: translation of
a Greek proverb, ἵππος με φέρει,
βασιλεύς με τρέφει, doubtless used
in reference to courtiers.

21. officium facio, I do service,
as a dependent. - poscis vilia re-
rum: i.e. you also beg, and only
for a paltry reward. — vilia rerum:
cf. vanis rerum, Sat. 11. 2. 25, and
fictis rerum, Sat. 11. 8. 83.

22. dante minor: i.e. you rec-
ognize your inferiority to the poor
wretches from whom you get your
sustenance. ‘⁴ 1 at least serve a
worthy person for a worthy reward;
you serve the crowd for a wretched
sare.” Diogenes and such persons
supported themselves by begging.
