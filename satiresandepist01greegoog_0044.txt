24 HORATI SERMONES.

[Lm. I.

neglectis urenda filix innascitur agris

Illuc praevertamuri amatorem quod amicae
turpia decipiunt caecum vitia, aut etiam ipsa haec
delectant, veluti Balbinum polypus Hagnae: 40
vellem in amicitia sic erraremuS, et isti
errori nomen virtus posuisset honestum.
At pater ut gnati, sic nos debemus amici
si quod sit vitium non fastidire ; strabonem
appellat paetum pater, et pullum, male parvus 45
si cui filius est, ut abortivus fuit olim
Sisyphus ; hunc varum distortis cruribus ; illurn
balbutit scaurum pravis fultum male talis.

37. urenda, to be burnedwithfire.
38. illuc, to this point, referring,
as often in Latin, to what follows.

— praevertamur, let us turn, in

preference to any other subject.

had reckoned this among the vir-
tueS, which of course in the Stoic
school it could not do.

43. gnati, with his son, changing
the construction to keep the em-

39. decipiunt, escape the notice phasis and the order of the words.

qs: Cf. fallo.

40. Balbinum. nothingisknown
of this case, but it explains itself.

41. vellem. notice that the wish
is contrary to the actual fact.

42. virtus: i.e. philosophers in
their discussions on virtue. The
Stoics are particularly referred to,
whose high ideal of virtue and ten-
dency to puritanism apparently
made them especially inclined to
censoriousnesS, and against whom
Horace never loses an opportunity
to break alance. Cf. v. 96 et seq. -
honestum: the Stoic made “the
becoming,'’ τὸ πρέπον, i.e. what was
in accordance with the nature of
man and the universe, the criterion
of virtue. Of this expression ho-
nestum is the Latin translation,
and the word is here used with
reference to this technical sense.
Hence it means virtuouS, but as
virtus is best translated virtue, we
may translate honorable. At any
rate, the whole means, that Ethics

44. fastidire, be too critical. -
strabonem: the point of the pas-
sage lies in the fact that the de-
εετίΙρῐὶῙνὲε words, most of which tare
rea oman nameS‚ are o wo
classeS, the first denoting an exces-
ῗὲῖῐέἕῗὶῖζὲἔοῗέ ἓέῗεὲῗι 1323ae
with which latter class the fond
father nieknames his son. — strabo-
nem, lzis ‘-‘cock eyed'’ son. All the
names should be· given in Latin
with the translation.

45. appellat. cf. Luer. IV. 1160.
— paetum, Blinky. — pullum,
Chicky. —- male, wretchedly.

47. Sisyphus: a famous dwarf,
kept by Mark Antony. Such per-
sons were very common in the-
suites of the Roman nobles, acting
as jesters. —varum‚ little Bandy-
le .

828. balbutit, calls in childish
accents. — scaurum, little Stampy,
properly with misshapen ankles. —
male, sadly (with pravis).
