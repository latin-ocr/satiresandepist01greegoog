52. ambitione: (referring to
Maecenas). Every means of adding
to one's influence, and every at-
tempt to get on ,in the political
career, the object of both high and
low, was among the Romans called
ambitio. Especially so was any at-

tempt to gain favor either by the Ι

powerful or the humble. —- felicem.

i. e. because that implies good luck‚
an idea which is repeated in casu
and sortitus (s.c sim), and again
in fors, etc.

55. VergiliuS, the poet Virgil,
wh0, like most of the writers of
talent at the time, was an intimate
friend of Maecenas, whose generous

consequence from some provincial
city, nor that my father had great
estates at Tarentum.

59. Satureiano: said by a scho-
liast to be from Satureia, a name of
Tarentum; at any rate it was in
that vicinity, and indicates estates
in Southern Italy. —caballo. ap-
parently the popular word (cf. the
Romance words).

60. quod eram. we should ex·
pect in Latin an indirect question
(cf.·v. 55), but here it is “ the posi·
tion, etc., that 1 held.''

63. turpi, honestum: strictly the
neuter forms3 turpe and honestum,
the technical Stoic names for virtue
and vice, but here used to include
persons (cf. I. 3. 42, note, and Ep.

95⁵{a'tqui2 i .e. though Ι ‘claim
no proud descent from my father,
yet it is to him that Ι owe whatever
I arn—mediocribus: i.e. only
such. Cf. Ι. 4. 130.
