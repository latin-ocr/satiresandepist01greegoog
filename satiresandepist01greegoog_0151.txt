HORATI SERMONES. 131

magnus erit, forti nubet procera Corano

filia Nasicae, metuentis reddere soldum. ⁶5
Tum gener hoc faciet : tabulas socero dabit atque

ut legat orabit ; multum Nasica negatas

’ accipiet tandem et tacitus leget, invenietque

nil sibi legatum praeter plorare suisque.

Illud-ad haec iubeo: mulier si forte dgolosa 70
libertusve senem delirum temperet, illis
accedas socius; laudes, lauderis ut absens ;

expugnare caput.

64. forti: cf. 11. 1. 16, 3. 216.—
proeera: corresponding to forti
and suggesting a fine figure. Both
are no doubt stock epithets for a
newly married pair, like ‘⁶ gallant
bridegroom '² and ‘⁶ fair bride.''

65. Nasicae, etc.: the father-in-
law being indebted to the son-in·laW,
has given him his daughter to secure
his favor. —. metuentis: simply a
strong form for nolentis. — sol-
dum: i.e. solidum, the principal
of the debt.

66. tabulas: as in v. 52.

69. legatum: a technical word.
Under the Roman law of wills it
was necessary that one or more per-
‘sons should be heredes or direct
legatees who represented the estate
or succession, and any sum that they
were directed to pay was said to
be legatum ab eis· Here, however,
Horace probany does not use the
word technically, but only in a gen·
etal sense, as English left. — plo·
rare: treated like a noun governed
by praeter. Itis used asin I. 10. 91,
equivalent to a curse. The whole

story shows comically how “ the

*biter '' may sometimes be ‘⁴ bit.'’

70. illud, etc.: other less direct
means of gaining favor. —- mulier:
doubtless a freedwoman mistress.

72. sociusz implying that they
are engaged in the same enterprise.

73. hoc: i.e. the scheme referred
to. —vincit, carries off the palm, as
compared with the indirect means.
—longe priua, by sar the better
course. »

with the force of a condition. —-

· mala, worthless (cf. 11. 1. 83).—

vecors: in Latin cor included the
intellectual as well as the moral pow-
ers, to which last we have limited
the heart later.

75. laudato: the second form of
the imperative used as often in a
general command. — roget: the ne
ishomitted here as frequently else-
w ere.

76. potiori, your superior, more
worthy than you. — putasne: in
response to the idea implied in the
