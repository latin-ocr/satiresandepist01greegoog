post effert animi motus interprete lingua.

Si dicentis erunt fortunis absona dicta,

Romani tollent equites peditesque cachinnum.

Intererit multum divusne loquatur an herOS,
maturusne senex an adhuc florente iuventa 115
fervidus, an matrona potenS, an sedula nutrix,
mercatorne vaguS, cultorne virentis agelli,

Colchus an AssyriuS, Thebis nutritus an Argis.

impiger, iracundUS, inexorabilis, acer

iura neget sibi nata, nihil non arroget armis,

Sit Medea ferox invictaque, flebilis Ino,

characterization, one must follow

conventional modeIS, or in case one
invents a new character he must
make it consistent. ⁴

illustrious.— reponis: cf. ponere,
v. 34.

125. si quid, etc.: a develop-
ment of sibi convenientia, v. 1 19.

128. proprie, with ortgu'nality,
i.e. so as to make them one’s own,
as opposed to mere imitation.

unheard of. The precept has a
