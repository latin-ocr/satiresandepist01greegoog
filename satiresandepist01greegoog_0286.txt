HORATI EPISTVLAE.

[Lm. ΙΙ.

Praeter cetera, me Romaene poemata censes 65
scribere posse inter tot curas totque labores?
Hic sponsum vocat, hic auditum scripta relictis
omnibus officiiS, cubat hic in colle Quirini,
hic extremo in Aventino, visendus uterque;
intervalla vides humane commoda. Verum 70
purae sunt plateae, nihil ut meditantibus obstet.
Festinat calidus mulis gerulisque redemptor,
torquet nunc lapidem nunc ingens machina tignum,
tristia robustis luctantur funera plaustriS, ,
hac rabiosa fugit caniS, hac lutulenta ruit sus‘: 75
i nune, et versus tecum meditare canoros! ⁴
Scriptorum chorus omnis amat nemus et fugit urbeS,

Pliny, Ep. ΙΙΙ. 18. —relictiS, etc.:
indicating the urgency of the invi·
tation.

68. cubat: cf. Sat. I. 9. 18.

69. visendus: such visits seem
to have been regarded as a duty

way (hence the plural), and up and
down two rather steep hius. His
whole walk to visit the two would
be about four miles. — humane ’fl'f
a poor mortal. —commoda. ironi-

objection, “but one can study on
the way ’'; cf. Sat. 1. 9. 2.

71. purae, clear. — meditanti-

technical word of persons engaged

drawn or carried through the streets.
The streets, though closed to wagons
except at night, were open to public
