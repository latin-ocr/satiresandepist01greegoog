HORATI EPISTVLAE. 245

Vt primum positis nugari Graecia bellis

coepit et in vitium fortuna labier aequa,

nunc athletarum studiis nunc arsit equorum, 95
marmoris aut eboris fabros aut aeris amavit,

suspendit picta vultum mentemque tabella,

nunc tibicinibus nunc est gavisa tragoedis;

sub nutrice puella velut si luderet infanS,

quod cupide petiit, mature plena reliquit. 100
Quid placet aut odio est, quod non mutabile credas?
Hoc paces habuere bonae ventique secundi.

mane domo vigilare, clienti promere iura,

cautos nominibus rectis expendere nummOS, 105
maiores audire, minori dicere per quae ’

here describes the rise of art in
Greece a'nd Rome, showing that it

a statement of the practical spirit of
the earlier Romans which prevented
them from attaining the excellence
that among the Greeks bloomed of
a sudden on account of the leisure
affor-ded by prosperity. —- nugari, to
diver! itsegf, as com ared with the
serious business of t e earlier wars.

94. vitiumz in the true Roman
spirit, Horace calls all such frivoli-
ties faulty, and so impliedly puts
the Roman practical serious pursuits
above the Greek trifling, while at
the same time he assei-ts the Greek
superiority in these trifles.

stancy, captivated by one object and,
soon satiated‚ leaving it for another.

103. Romae, etc.= i.e. at Rome,
on the other hand, the people were
devoted to political and economic
pursuits and moral culture (cf. II.
3. 323 seq.); hence they could not
be expected to practise the frivolous
arts; but cf. v. 108 for the change
which took place under Augustus.
—— reclusa, with open doors, ex·
pecting a throng of clients, who
came to make the morning call and
get advice (cf. promere iura). This
